				<h1>Project Overview</h1>
				
				<!-- Section 1 -->
				<p>
					Eleven policy questions have been developed to structure and guide the Value Pricing Pilot (VPP) regional parking project’s (“the Project”) policy analysis and best practices research. This site introduces the approach to addressing the issues raised in the Project by itemizing the eleven policy questions identified in the study, explaining its purpose, and discussing analytical, modeling, policy, and/or expert research on the topic. The methods outlined below will be used to address these policy questions throughout the Project timeline:
				</p>
				<ol class="project-ol">
					<li>1. Information gleaned from literature review, including:</li>
					<Li>
						<ul class="project-ul">
							<li>Current best practices, particularly relating to pricing, and</li>
							<li>Existing academic research.</li>
						</ul>
					</Li>
					<li>2. Focused research, including:</li>
					<li>
						<ul class="project-ul">
							<li>Applications of best practice policies relating to pricing,</li>
							<li>Analysis of applications and how they relate to the Bay Area, and</li>
							<li>Analysis of surveys that have been conducted for studies within the Bay Area.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>3. Original work of this effort, including :</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<!-- Section 2 -->
				<p class="ma-top-l">
					Within this site, the discussion on each policy question includes the purpose of each question, the audience most likely to benefit from the information provided and the significance of its policy application. The best practice policy application also includes short descriptions of examples of best practice policies that have been applied in the United States. While this review is not exhaustive, it covers many of the most effective parking policies that exist today. Select policy questions include original work as well as information on the challenges concerning our ability to answer the policy question(s).

					Two of the Policy Questions in the Project use modeling tools—UrbanSim and Travel Model One—to help address them. These tools have not yet been applied to parking, and the analysis for these questions include discussions on how new uses and further development of the land use and travel models allowed for further parking simulation.

                    <h2 class="research-header-h2">Policy Question &#8211; Parking Cash-out</h2>
                    <p class="research-sub-header">
	                    What would be the impact on employment location and types, and on employees’ income of a regional parking cash-out program?
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="research-header-h3 page-header">Question Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
	                    What is the purpose of this question, why is it important, and who is the intended audience
                    </p>
                    <p>Employee based pricing or incentive programs create a choice between a free parking space and cash, incentivizing employees not to park at work, and instead use alternative modes such as carpool, transit, walk, or bicycle. Beneficial impacts of these programs have been seen, yet implementation has been limited and employers appear to be resistant to change without incentive. This question can provide information to MTC and other regional agencies, as well as local governments and employers, on the efficacy and impacts of a regional parking cash-out program. In addition, the State of California could be interested in relation to the State Parking Cash-out law.</p>
                    <h3 class="research-header-h3 page-header">Overview of Analysis</h3>
                    <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the abstract, this question would be studied by taking before and after data of a range of parking cash-out programs, then simulating regional results through the regional land use and travel models. Because no cases of parking cash out implementation are available to study in the Bay Area, this question is addressed primarily through review of parking cash-out programs in other locations, results of programs bearing similarities to parking cash-out, relevant existing papers, new case studies, and expert analysis. In the future, the analysis could be used for modeling changes in incomes based on commuter mode choice.</p>
                    <p>Given the limited implementation of parking cash-out programs, similar programs such as commuter benefit programs and other trip reduction strategies are also reviewed for useful indications of the potential effectiveness of parking cash out programs.</p>
                    <h2 class="research-header-h2 page-header">Background &amp; Research</h2>
                    <h4 class="research-header-h3">Literature Review: Parking Cash-out</h4>
                    <div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_323" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
                        <a href="https://parkingpolicy.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ucla-hospital-station1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-323 " src="https://parkingpolicy.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/ucla-hospital-station1.jpg?w=269&#038;h=269" alt="Bikeshare Programs in West Los Angeles" width="269" height="269" />
                        </a>
                        <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1: Cash Out programs encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation by refunding employees the cost of their parking spot. Image: City of Santa Monica</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Each parking space that an employer provides has a cost (typically born by the employer), yet whether an employee parks at work or not, each employee is affected similarly by this cost. This cost is often indirect for employers and they are unaware of it as it is bundled into rent. This cost for employers is usually an indirect cost for employees, yet even the employees who aren’t parking at work are paying equally for this space. Employee based pricing, or incentive programs, create a choice between the free parking space and cash value that incentivizes employees to carpool, take transit, walk, telecommute, or bicycle to work.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>A 1990 study compared employees before and after free parking was eliminated. In five locations analyzed, drive-alone mode share fell by 41% when employees had to pay to park.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a> Additionally, a survey of Bay Area commuters conducted in 2000 found that 77% of commuters with free parking drove alone, while only 39% of those who had to pay drove alone. It is not easy to determine the extent to which this effect is directly due to the cost of parking, and how much is due to other correlating factors, notably superior transit service in areas with paid parking.</p>
                    <p>Willson (1991) used a multinomial logit model to estimate how employees will commute differently in response to being charged for parking. Willson’s model estimates that 25-34% fewer vehicles would be driven to work when employees are charged for parking, rather than receiving free parking. Fewer vehicles driven to work would also encourage a cultural shift towards public transit and alternative modes of transportation. With such a cultural shift, total demand may decrease for parking for non-commuting trips as well.</p>
                    <h4 class="research-header-h4">Policy Application: California’s Parking Cash-out Law</h4>
                    <p>Enacted in 1992, California’s Parking Cash-out Law (AB 2109, KATZ)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[3]</a> requires employers with more than 50 employees (and certain additional qualifying characteristics) to offer a parking cash-out program.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[4]</a> An analysis of eight employers who complied with the law resulted in a 17% decrease in single-occupancy drivers after the cash-out program (Shoup, 1997). Additionally, these eight employers saw an average carpooling increase of 64%, transit ridership increase of 50%, and walk/bike mode share increase of 33%. While large impacts were seen from the few employers who do participate, the California legislation did not make a sizable impact statewide as the state has not taken steps to enforce the law, leaving it instead to the local municipalities (Sorensen et al., 2008). Additionally, many employers find exemptions due to the specific criteria for those required to participate. For example, parking owned rather than leased by employers is exempt from the law. Hill and Long (2002) estimate that only 3% of all employers are required to participate.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[5]</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>A study by the CA Center for Sustainable Communities (2013) assesses the potential impact if 25%-50% of employers with 50 or more employees were to participate in the parking cash-out program. <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[6]</a> The study’s analysis estimates a 2.7-7.8% reduction in automobile commutes (which average 13.2 miles per day and consist of about 23% of all driving in California).</p>
                    <h4  class="research-sub-header">Policy Application: Santa Monica’s Parking Cash-Out Policies</h4>
                    <p>While significant impacts were seen from the few employers who do participate in California’s Parking Cash-out Law, the legislation has not made a sizable impact as the state has not taken steps to enforce the law.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[7]</a> Since 1996, the City of Santa Monica has taken steps to enforce the state’s parking cash-out law, requiring employees to comply as part of their Emissions Reduction Plan. One-third of all employers with at least 100 employees were participating as of the City’s 1998 survey. This survey found that of all participants, 20% of employees chose to rideshare to work and take the parking cash-out.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[8]</a> This increased effort to enforce the state parking cash-out law could be applied on a wider scale, increasing the effectiveness and reach of the program throughout the entire region.</p>
                    <h4  class="research-sub-header">Policy Application: Washington’s Commute Trip Reduction Law</h4>
                    <p>Similar to the Bay Area Commuter Benefits Program detailed in Policy Question 7, in 1991 the state of Washington passed the Commute Trip Reduction law in 1991, requiring large companies to take steps to reduce automobile trips by employees. Washington’s Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) Law focuses on reducing drive-alone mode share by requiring larger employees to participate in programs that encourage employees to take alternative modes. Washington’s law requires employees to create and manage their own programs, based on guidelines by local jurisdictions. With 1,050 worksites and 530,000 employees currently participating, the program has been successful in (1) saving fuel and time costs by reducing traffic delays during rush-hour (2) reducing total driving by a total of 154 million miles from 2007-2013, and (3) preventing 69,000 metric tons of GHG emissions.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[9]</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>In response, SAFECO Insurance Company offered transit passes and ridesharing incentives to all employees in order to reduce demand for parking. With flexible parking requirements, city officials allowed the company to increase development density and reduce the number of required parking spaces in SAFECO’s new building in Redmond, WA. Since the program’s start in 1997, SAFECO has kept drive-alone trips below 60%, while the county’s average rate is 81%. In addition to the environmental benefits of fewer vehicle emissions and reduced runoff from less paved area, the company saves an estimated $491,000 per year from parking construction and maintenance costs.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[10]</a>
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="research-sub-header">Policy Application: Boulder Colorado Transit Passes</h4>
                    <p>An alternative to offering employees cash as a substitute for their parking space is offering a transit pass. Boulder, Colorado offers free transit passes (the EcoPass) to full-time employees located within BID boundaries. These free employee Eco Passes are funded by parking fees in the downtown. The City of Boulder was looking to increase their transit ridership as the core benefit, rather than make more parking available for customers.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[11]</a> However, this is another benefit to areas with constrained on-street parking resources.</p>
                    <div style="width: 286px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="" src="https://parkingpolicy.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/eco_pass_banner.jpg?w=276&#038;h=105" alt="Eco_Pass_Banner" width="276" height="105" />
                        <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2: The EcoPass is an annual RTD (Regional Transportation District) transit pass purchased by employers for their employees providing unlimited regional, express, local bus and light rail service throughout the Denver and Boulder regions. Image: City of Boulder</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>In analyzing the feasibility of a free employee transit pass program, Boulder acknowledged that the cost of bus fare can be a significant barrier to using transit for car owners. However, the cost of commuting by vehicle is still high and can be a barrier to low-wage earners. The EcoPass improves access to jobs while also reducing an employee’s dependence on their private vehicle.</p>
                    <p>In February 2014, a study on the feasibility of expanding the Eco Pass program to the wider community was completed, estimating that the program could increase transit ridership between 22 and 64 percent, depending on the amount of resources put into the effort. The existing program has resulted in approximately 7.85 million additional transit boardings per year and 865 million reduced vehicle-miles traveled per year in the City of Boulder.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-header-4">Policy Application: Genentech’s gRide Rewards program</h4>
                    <div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_328" style="width: 327px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
                        <a href="https://parkingpolicy.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/genentech.jpg"><img class="wp-image-328" src="https://parkingpolicy.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/genentech.jpg?w=317&#038;h=166" alt="genentech" width="317" height="166" />
                        </a>
                        <p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3: Genetech offers employees $4/day per passenger not to drive alone to work, as well as shuttle bus services. Image: MTC.gov</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Genentech’s South San Francisco and Oceanside campuses offer employees $4/day per passenger not to drive alone to work (including carpool, vanpool, transit, and non-motorized modes). This is approximately $80/month or $1,000/year. In 2012, the program reported that it saved more than 100million miles of commuting, taking many vehicles off the road. Each month, more than 3,000 employees participate in gRide Rewards; 41% of the office’s employees take modes other than drive-alone (an increase from 2006 of 22%). To make this program easier, Genentech also offers 38 shuttle buses, or GenenBuses, to provide rides to employees. It should be noted that Genentech is operating under the trip reduction policy goals of the San Mateo City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG), and has a major financial incentive to expand their business while not increase the number of employee commute trips.</p>
                    <h3 class="research-header-h3 page-header">Challenges</h3>
                    <p>While there are several studies and examples, a full analysis of the impact of such a program is difficult. There is a lot of potential in the future for simulating regional effects of parking cash-out in UrbanSim, the capabilities and sensitivity of the parking submodel are uncertain and not yet ready for implementing testing. Additionally, the slow or limited implementation of parking cash-out policies may be due to a combination of lack of financial motivation by employers, due to lack of full or direct control of parking resources, and organizational/institutional inertia – both of which are difficult to model.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that the environment for effective parking cash–out may be limited by the separation of financial responsibilities between employers and owners of parking, and thus limited opportunities for anyone to directly take advantage of efficiencies in pricing parking. For example, if an employer owns their own parking and there is a market for use of extra parking, or if an employer may choose to lease less parking, then they have an incentive to reduce the amount of parking used by the employees and to lease out the excess parking. Parking cash-out could work well in this situation. Parking cash-out could also work well if an employer/property owner wishes to expand operations and is allowed to build on land that is freed up through parking reduction programs. However, most employers do not own the parking used by their employees, and/or many do not have a choice as to how much parking to lease with an option of savings for the employer. Therefore if such an employer with fixed costs for parking for employees offers financial incentives for employees to not park at work, the employer may incur the cost of the incentive and yet derive no financial benefit from the reduced use of parking.</p>
                    <h3 class="research-sub-header">Potential Policy Actions</h3>
                    <p>One potential policy action is to enforce California’s parking cash out law in the Bay Area. This could be done on a local level or a regional level. Additionally, parking cash-out or other employer-based incentives for employees to give up their parking space could be supported with local policies. These policies could include transit passes, or required parking fees by employers.</p>
                    <p>A renewed Bay Area Commuter Benefits Ordinance (CBO) could require employers to charge for parking, offer a parking cash out for those who opt out of a parking space, or provide a transit pass option for those who opt out of a parking space.</p>

				            Policy Question: What are the most effective actions the regional agencies can take to support pricing parking policies?
			            </p>
			            <h3 class="research-header-h3">Question Purpose</h3>
			            <p>
				           What is the purpose of this question, why is it important, and who is the intended audience?
			            </p>
			            <p>
				            The purpose of this question is to obtain recommendations for the regional agencies to support the development of effective regional parking policies within the economic and political environment of the Bay Area. Parking policies are typically implemented by local jurisdictions, yet these locally made parking policies impact regional transportation patterns—including the use of transit, vehicle use, traffic congestion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the short run, and development patterns and land use/development prices in the long run.
				        </p>
			            <p>
				            Transportation issues are addressed at the local, county and regional level in the Bay Area. MTC/ABAG are required by state law to address specific housing and GHG goals in the regional transportation plan, and also have a number of other goals that are potentially impacted by parking policies, including housing affordability and transportation costs. Approximately 40% of GHG emissions come from the transportation sector in the SF Bay Area. Given State requirements to reduce GHG, the regional agencies are seeking approaches on all fronts to help achieve these goals.

				            A number of Bay Area cities have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of parking pricing and management through reforms to local parking policies, including notable approaches in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Redwood City. Many areas in the Bay Area currently do not charge for parking, despite high demand and/or continual construction of costly parking facilities. It appears that widespread local adoption of parking pricing and related policy reforms may not occur without action at the regional level. Key impediments appear to be the hidden nature of parking subsidies for both the public and for planners; a general resistance to change to long accepted parking policies by professionals; a lack of local constituents in favor of priced and other reformed parking policies; the perception that cities need to compete for retail customers through the use of free parking; and a lack of familiarity and knowledge of the shifting demand market for housing with less parking.
				         </p>
			            <p>
				            More fundamentally, parking pricing only makes sense if it is rationing a scarce resource. Most suburban jurisdictions and many urban jurisdictions require parking quantities that developers would not voluntarily provide since the end users would not be willing to pay for that supply. Local ordinances in some Bay Area cities require an excess aggregate supply of parking, and when that occurs, both parking pricing and parking management are largely irrelevant. Even if those jurisdictions have reformed their parking requirement, the legacy effect of past requirements is that there is an aggregate oversupply of parking in most locations. This oversupply of parking, of course, pushes the market price to zero. Artificially imposing pricing in a parking oversupply environment may shift parking location, as people switch from priced locations to unpriced ones, but it does not affect parking demand since there are plenty of parking alternatives.
				        </p>
			            <p>
				            The most effective long-term strategy to encourage pricing is to reform and/or eliminate parking requirements and to adopt development policies that allow development on excess parking lots. The question for regional entities is the ways in which they can accelerate that reform process. Parking requirements are part of local zoning authority that resides with cities unless the State of California intervenes. Regional entities are in a weak position to require changes in local practices, despite many worthy efforts that are documented in the next section.
				        </p>
			            <p>
				            Having noted the limitations of regional entities, it is important to note that regional approaches to parking policies may offer benefits to the region, local jurisdictions within the region, and the public. At the macro level, a regional oversupply represents an underutilization of valuable land resources. Regional parking policies could potentially benefit the region by creating more economic efficiency through better use of land and reduced subsidies for parking. Regional parking pricing policies can also address potential consistency issues in parking policies across city boundaries. For example, issues sometimes arise due to cities competing because they fear that businesses will lose customers to neighboring cities if they start charging for parking.

				            Analysis of the most effective actions regional agencies will provide basis for development of regional policies by MTC/ABAG and potentially other regional or state agencies such as the Bay Area Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and Caltrans that are effective under conditions of limited staff time and political sensitivity.

			            <h3 class="research-header-h3">Overview of Analysis</h3>
			            <p>
				            How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations?
			            </p>
			            <p>Ideally, the project would provide an extensive analysis of successful parking pricing programs in other regions or other parts of the world, including results/impacts where possible, along with an analysis of the economic/political context and the extent to which certain policies might be feasible and effective in the Bay Area. The project would incorporate this information into the regional models and compare their impact side-by-side as well as qualitatively evaluate their political feasibility.</p>
			            <p>Due to limited resources, this question is addressed through review of examples of regional or similar level frameworks for parking pricing policies as well as in a discussion-based context, including expert panel discussions and feedback from local and regional representatives. The project focuses on a detailed review of key examples of regional approaches to pricing policies to provide the most value to the region.</p>

			            <p>
			                <a name="_Toc389490482"></a>Addressing this question requires thorough analysis and review of actions that regional agencies can take to support parking pricing. This includes analyzing a range of reports conducted by transportation agencies in the Bay Area. These materials will inform specific policies that are recommended as the most effective regional actions for the Bay Area. The best practices below highlight some of the key research and reports that will be used in the full analysis of this question.</p>
			            <p>
			                <a name="_Toc389490483"></a>Currently the regional agencies use a combination of funding support for specific local projects (particularly those with air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits), planning processes, and cooperative work with local jurisdictions. This section includes descriptions of some key policies and programs, as well as potential to expand them or use similar tools to continue working towards similar goals—that regional agencies in the Bay Area have implemented with these strategies.</p>

			            <p>MTC conducted a study directly addressing the question of what regional strategies would be effective in supporting widespread parking reform in the Bay Area, as reported in <em>Regional Parking Strategies for Climate Protection</em>, January 2010. This report provides a solid foundation for addressing this question of which actions are most effective regional by assessing the interests, authorities and relationships between various stakeholders and policy makers. The study presents and applies criteria for evaluating potential policies, and recommends strategies for policy implementation, including an approach for monitoring and evaluating implementation and performance.</p>
			            <p>MTC has conducted a range of studies in the last couple of years relating to policies that involve parking or focus entirely on parking policies.<strong> Table 10</strong> briefly lists a handful of regional actions related to parking by MTC.</p>

			            <p>Developed by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and MTC, the Bay Area has implemented a region-wide Commuter Benefits Program<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> (as described below), expansion of this program could include parking cash-out and employee transit passes, where success at the local level combined with larger-scale policy efforts suggest that these policies would be good opportunities for region-wide efforts to encourage alternative means of transportation to work. In addition to the state of Washington’s Commute Reduction Law and Boulder’s Employee Transit Program, a few examples below discuss regional-applicable examples in and nearby the Bay Area.</p>
			            <p>MTC’s Climate Initiatives Program</p>
			            <p>Very recently (summer 2015) MTC developed a small new pilot funding program focused on implementation of Transportation Demand Management in the Climate Initiative Program which is focused on the parking management strategies. This program will assist with equipment costs for smart meters, detection systems, wayfinding and enforcement programs. This is a new program, and future steps will depend on the effectiveness of this pilot project.</p>
			            <p>The Climate Initiatives Program is a joint effort by the regional agencies: the Association of Bay Area Governments, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (One Bay Area, 2014). These agencies have funded a number of major demonstration projects to test the most innovative strategies to promote changes in driving and travel behaviors, providing an opportunity to learn what kinds of strategies can most effectively reduce GHG emissions. A number of projects have a parking policy component, including goBerkeley and the Integrated Public-Private Transportation Demand Management Project. The regional agencies can learn from these innovations as well as promoting other innovations in future projects, and local jurisdictions can benefit from these experiments and analyses in innovation.</p>

			            <p>The regional transportation plan (Plan Bay Area) assists jurisdictions seeking to implement Plan Bay Area at the local level by providing funding for Priority Development Area (PDA) planning and transportation projects, technical assistance, and funding to support local professional staffing for such efforts. There is currently guidance regarding analysis of parking for PDA plans, yet this guidance could potentially be strengthened.</p>
			            <p>Plan Bay Area also provides jurisdictions with the option of increasing the efficiency of the development process for projects consistent with the plan and other criteria included in SB 375. Policies could also be developed, related to this policy or as a stand-alone, to directly encourage or mandate the reduction in local parking requirements for development in transit priority places (TPPs), as was considered in AB 904 (Skinner) in 2011-12 session (which was withdrawn).</p>
			            <p>The Regional Prosperity Plan</p>
			            <p>The Bay Area Regional Prosperity Plan includes a $5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, ABAG, and MTC. The Prosperity Plan program spans three years and aims to promote sustainable communities and foster a clean energy environment. Through grants such as this one, regional agencies can create or support a parking certification program to bestow recognition on communities, employers and developers who implement innovative parking reforms, such as TransForm’s GreenTRIP program. TransForm’s GreenTRIP program includes a tool for estimating actual levels of parking demand and trip generation in transit-oriented areas. This tool will help address barriers to development, helping to reduce the cost of housing by eliminating underutilized parking spaces. Regional areas can help create or support parking programs by allowing parking reforms based on this tool.</p>
			            <p>CEQA and Parking</p>
			            <p>One successful policy action that was recently signed into law (effective January 1, 2014) is SB 743. SB 743 makes several changes to CEQA so that most projects located in PDAs in the Bay Area would no longer be required to consider aesthetics and adequacy of parking under CEQA. SB 743 provides that “aesthetics and parking impacts of a residential, mixed use residential, or employment center project on an infill site within a transit priority area shall not be considered significant impacts on the environment.” To avoid this consideration, a project must meet the following three criteria: (1) it is in a transit priority area; (2) it is on an infill site; and (3) it is a residential, mixed-use residential, or an employment center.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a> This success was made possible by several efforts by San Francisco and the Bay Area to recognize that parking supply in transit-oriented and high density areas should not be evaluated by the same methods and/or criteria as lower-density, automobile-oriented areas.</p>
			            <p>TransitLink for TOD (T4T) Pilot Program</p>
			            <p>MTC conducted a pilot project, in concert with AC Transit, to evaluate the long term impacts of a short term free transit pass program for residents of transit oriented developments.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[3]</a> The pass program resulted in both immediate and long term reductions in automobile trips and immediate and long term increases in the use of transit, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Pilot programs have the potential to expand throughout the Bay Area transit system with partnership between transit agencies and regional planning agencies. Transit subsidies and incentives for residents and employees of transit oriented developments could be implemented in several ways to reduce parking demand.</p>
			            <p>Commuter Benefits Program</p>
			            <p>Partially in response to the low level of participation in the State Parking Cash-out Program described above, and inspired by local commuter benefit ordinances (for examples, see the programs in San Francisco, Richmond, Berkeley, and San Francisco International Airport), MTC and the Bay Area Bay Area Air Quality Management District sought and received State authorization to implement the Bay Area Commuter Benefits Program. The program is being piloted from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2016 with the goal of reducing drive-alone commute trips to Bay Area worksites and therefore decreasing traffic congestion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while saving employees (and potentially employers) money. The Program requires employers with at least 50 full-time employees to offer 1 of 4 commuter benefits options: (1) up to $130 per month tax-free transit or vanpool costs, (2) up to $75 per month employer-provided transit or vanpool subsidy (3) Employer-provided free or low cost bus, shuttle or vanpool service (4) or an alternative commuter benefit of the employer’s choice that is as effective in reducing drive-alone mode share.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[4]</a>
			            </p>
			            <p>This program was recently implemented, so the impact and results are not yet known. However, similar programs in place by individual employers have been studied. The 2010 Commuter Benefit Impact Survey found that employees were twice as likely to use an alternative mode of transportation if their workplace offered tax-free transit.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[5]</a> A report by the Transit Cooperative Research Program (2005) found significant impacts from commuter benefits programs, including a typical transit mode share increase of 10% or more.</p>
			            <p class="LFTHeading4">Parking Requirement Reform</p>
			            <p class="LFTBody">Oversupplied parking is unpriced and general unmanaged. For example, the circumstance of a typical suburban mall is that parking is sized for a few of the busiest shopping days of the year, vastly oversupplying parking for the rest of the year. As described in Table 4, MTC has initiated a number of programs to accelerate this process, by providing information, analytical tools, workshops, and research. These efforts are working on the critical issue – parking supply – and they should be redoubled to set the basis for encouraging parking pricing. Regional efforts to encourage parking requirement reform could include funding local parking requirement consulting studies, educational material regarding the effects of minimum parking requirements, and developing regional standards for parking requirements (by area type), and tying funding allocations to compliance with regional standard. Regional entities can highlight best practice cities to show jurisdictions how reform works and the positive economic development, urban design, social justice, and VMT reduction benefits.</p>
			            <p class="LFTBody">The greatest inefficiencies in parking use are the result of separated land uses. Mixed land uses naturally lend themselves to shared parking and great use efficiency. Therefore, regional support for local reform should not be limited to the parking requirements themselves – it should also support the adoption of mixed land use models that support shared parking. In addition, design regulations should require pedestrian access between sites to facilitate shared parking. Regional entities can provide best practice models, fund planning efforts and zoning rewrites, and tie other forms of funding to the reform of local planning.</p>
			            <p class="LFTBody">State interventions such as that proposed by AB 904 can give local planners the cover to advance parking reform in their communities. Consistent with member cities’ perspectives, MTC could work with state legislators to support reform requirements that recognize local concerns.</p>
			            <p class="LFTHeading4">Expand MTC’s Resolution 3434 TOD Policy</p>
			            <p class="LFTBody">MTC’s Resolution 3434 TOD policy, adopted in 2005, allocates regional funds to select local agencies that plan for at least minimum threshold levels of residential development around future transit expansions. This requirement is a condition for readiness to move forward and provides funding for planning toward this purpose. This policy supports transit ridership by increasing development around stations, specifically in the ½-mile station area, aiming to improve transit investments and ease the Bay Area housing shortage by creating vibrant communities around transit.</p>
			            <p class="LFTBody">This policy should be considered for expansion to include analysis of multi-modal access, as well as pricing and management policy options prior to the funding of parking structures. A regional focus on transit ridership and increased residential and mixed use development around stations could be supported with several parking policies, including eliminated parking requirements and Parking Districts that give employee transit passes in lieu of parking spaces. With increased requirements for the intensity of development, regional agencies can give bonuses or establish requirements for funding mandating that TOD areas reduce the amount of subsidized parking in the area to encourage transit ridership.</p>
			            <p class="LFTHeading3">Expert Analysis</p>
			            <p class="Body">A panel of parking experts—including Donald Shoup, Elizabeth Deakin, Todd Litman, and Meea Kang—were interviewed and asked to give their experiences relating to this policy question. Each expert was asked ‘Do you have a favorite regional parking policy that MTC/regional agencies should consider pursuing?’ A summary of responses is given below.</p>
			            <p>Regional Policy Input – Expert Donald Shoup</p>

			            <p>Parking cash-out programs. One note about parking Cash-Out programs is that every City can pass their own penalty for violating the program, but the Air Quality Management District can set the penalty at the regional level. The law has already been passed; all that needs to be done is to set the penalty for violating the law. When it comes to parking, “I am pro-choice”.</p>

			            <p>I think it would be helpful if MTC would work on parking technologies that make it easier to have very low pricing, flexibility in pricing, and easier and less-expensive enforcement of parking, etc. because cities are trying to solve these problems. A regional approach to study technology options, improved technology, create best management practices (BMPs) for parking technologies, etc., because it is more cost efficient, effective and avoids duplication, to do this on a regional basis than city by city. There are examples of cities purchasing equipment that did not have the appropriate software security (i.e. enable flexible pricing strategies, enforcement, etc.) or equipment costing lots of money to repair, etc.</p>

			            <p>I agree with what all the previous panelists already stated, and MTC could help with implementation by providing the tools and information needed at the point that a decision is made. For example, the City of Seattle/Puget Sound Regional Council developed the Right Size Parking Calculator &#8211; a terrific device that allows the developer to identify the right amount of parking for their project. Communicating to the public about these approaches, strategies and the benefits others are experiencing would be helpful. MTC can help produce information via factsheets, brochures, websites, and calculators that are understandable to the public that focus on the direct benefits to various stakeholders of implementing these strategies. I think we are failing in terms of implementation and communication.</p>
			            <p>Recommendations</p>
			            <p>We have combined lessons learned from regional efforts, case studies from throughout the country and world, parking best practices research, travel models, and policy analyses with input from experts and transportation professionals to create a series of potential strategies and recommendations to reduce parking demand, encourage pricing policies, reduce housing costs and reduce GHG. Ideas range from simple extensions of current activities to new innovative strategies. The development of recommendations for regional actions to address the urgent nature of climate change in the multi-jurisdictional and highly charged world of regional transportation politics is complex. These ideas reflect the input of many dedicated professionals, and this approach is expected to result in new innovative policies to address these important concerns. Through this process we are hoping to develop effective, regional strategic actions to assist in the curbing of excessive GHGs in the shortest time frame possible.</p>
			            <p>Summary of Recommendations</p>
			            <p>The experiences from regional efforts to date as well as the parking best practices research available in this report were combined to create a series of recommendations that regional agencies may take to reduce parking demand and encourage pricing policies. The following recommendations also include references to best practice descriptions within this report for more details pertaining to the related best practice example.</p>
			            <ul class="color-blue">
			                <li>Increase support for operational projects, such as the recently started regional commuter benefits program, and refine these projects to incorporate more policies directly related to parking (see Regional Policy Application: Commuter Benefits Program above).</li>
			                <li>Require a robust analysis of proposed parking structures that includes parking demand and multi-modal access to the service area as well as financial proforma of the proposed facility prior to MTC contribution of regional funds.</li>
			                <li>Establish a parking certification program to recognize communities, employers and developers who implement parking reforms.</li>
			                <li>Intensify housing development in the immediate vicinity of transit stations to maximize ridership, as a trade-off for building parking through expansion of MTC’s Resolution 3434 TOD Policy (see Regional Policy Application: MTC’s Resolution 3434 TOD Policy above) or an alternative method of financially and politically supporting station area projects that meet minimum criteria.</li>
			                <li>Work with private and public sector—such as transit agencies, developers, employers, and schools—to benefit from partnerships to expand pilot programs that will reduce parking demand.</li>
			                <li>Include a requirement for regional analysis of parking structures when regional funds are used, especially in areas nearby transit stations (see MTC’s parking structure analysis in Policy Question 5).</li>
			                <li>A new regional parking fee or tax program, potentially with proceeds being returned to local jurisdictions for use on TDM projects. Parking taxes can be levied in a variety of ways to turn some of the indirect costs of parking back on the owner and/or user of parking, and can be used to support alternative access modes and other local livability improvements. Indirect costs of parking include foregone tax revenue, direct environmental effects such as runoff and urban heat island effects, and greenhouse gasses and other pollutants.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[6]</a>
			                </li>
			                <li>Engage local jurisdictions in a process to understand the meaning of the SB 743 CEQA changes, how these affect their community and planning process, and guidance for TOD and infill projects (see Regional Policy Application: CEQA and Parking above).</li>
			                <li>Support a pilot program to establish a Parking Benefit District, using meter revenue to fund programs that will decrease parking demand and benefit the community, such as transit passes for employees and/or residents who work/live in the area, therefore making more parking available for customers and visitors (see Policy Question #9: Parking Benefits District).</li>
			                <li>Provide local jurisdictions resources and incentives to enforce the State of California’s parking cash-out law (see Policy Application: Santa Monica’s Parking Cash-Out Policies above).</li>
			                <li>Expand the Commuter Benefit Program to include additional subsidies that support households and individuals who opt out of automobile ownership, for example by continuing recent expansions in Clipper Card integration to create a subsidy program for eligible TOD residents and/or employees who opt out of vehicle ownership.</li>
			                <li>Collect code and policy language of examples of strategies that address each of the major parking concerns that were identified by Cities in the 2011 MTC Parking Survey (see Policy Question 8) and make these examples publicly available for cities to use (Note: establishing the framework for doing this—an online database for parking information—is included within the goals of the VPP Parking Project).</li>
			                <li>Establish the framework, language, and incentive structure (potentially aided by experience through pilot programs or local best practices) for cities to implement policies that reduce parking demand (see description of Washington’s Commute Reduction Law in Policy Question 6).</li>
			            </ul>
			            <h3 class="color-white">Challenges</h3>
			            <p><em>What (if any) impediments inhibit our ability to answer the question entirely?</em>
			            </p>
			            <p>Only a handful of agencies have implemented parking pricing and management policies to date at a regional scale, so this project must innovate with few successful examples to learn from. Further, the political relationships within each region differ, requiring careful attention to the dynamics of the San Francisco Bay Area. While there are quantitative measurements we can gather from modeling policies, many elements of a policy that make it effective are qualitative in nature—such as feasibility and political acceptance. Many of the successful best practice policies/programs in other regions are not necessarily transferable, due to the differing political atmosphere.</p>

			                <h2 class="color-blue">Potential Policy Actions</h2>
			                <ul >
			                    <li>Fund continued and expanded data collection and develop, support, and refine the VPP parking database and data analysis tools. Further refinement of these tools will help data to analysis lead to strategies for implementation.</li>
			                    <li>Continue funding and guidance for PDA planning, technical and staff assistance for parking elements.</li>
			                    <li>Fund local/corridor parking implementation strategies and actual implementation (such as smart meters, wayfinding and clear regulatory signage, online permitting sales, personnel, pilot programs and enforcement technology)
			                        <ul>
			                            <li>Establish a regional parking space fee for congestion reduction and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction purposes, in coordination with the Air District, potentially including a return to source for neighborhoods, cities, CMAs, and or transit agencies to support livability measures and alternative modes.</li>
			                            <li>Develop a regional parking management system plan for local jurisdictions including steps of problem definition, analysis, development of strategies, pilots, equipment, and communications; the implementation of successful approaches should be on a broader scale, including new technologies, and maintenance and management.</li>
			                            <li>Regionally monitor, summarize and analyze local strategies, evaluate and make recommendations, and provide financial support regarding successful strategies.</li>

	                        <p><em>Under what conditions might cities and transit agencies want to enact or enforce various priced parking policies?</em>
	                        </p>
	                        <h3>Question Purpose</h3>
	                        <p><em>What is the purpose of this question, why is it important, and who is the intended audience?</em>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>Answers to this question will provide perspective and information to MTC/ABAG regarding where to effectively focus funding support for local parking policy activities, and to local jurisdictions and transit agencies regarding conditions that are likely to result in effective parking pricing strategies. These conditions range from specific locational land use and transportation characteristics, local trends regarding employment and residential growth, as well as the supply and demand factors in particular areas where policies have been implemented successfully.</p>
	                        <h3>Overview of Analysis</h3>
	                        <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>In the abstract, an extensive inventory of priced parking policies as well as their impacts and the conditions that led those areas to enact the policy successfully would be collected to answer this question. However, because of the qualitative nature and limited project resources, key examples of policy applications are collected and they are used as examples for the basis for gathering further advice and information from our expert panel.</p>
	                        <h2>Background &amp; Research</h2>
	                        <p>Conditions where cities or transit agencies may want to enact or enforce various priced parking policies are itemized below in <strong>Table 12</strong>. These are conditions that are directly observed through the project’s data collection or anecdotal evidence within cities throughout the Bay Area. Potential policies to address these conditions are listed along with corresponding references to further research within this report.</p>
	                        <p>These will be used as the basis for discussion with the Project’s expert panel.</p>

	                        <p>In 2011, a survey administered by MTC asked Cities how they rank concerns relating to implementing new parking policies and also asked how certain strategies would help. Examples of concerns include: neighborhood spillover, diminished retail competiveness, and lack of resources and leadership. Examples of support that cities ranked as most useful include grants, information sessions, and consultant assistance. Cross-analysis of concerns with research into conditions for cities to implement parking policies will help gain insight into what conditions are also barriers against policy implementation.</p>

	                        </p>
	                        <p>This question will be addressed in tandem with Policy Question #1 and Policy Question #10. The conditions under which cities and transit agencies want to enact or enforce various priced parking policies are analyzed across the Project’s data collection of 25 cities to understand how common they are.</p>

The challenge in answering this question is in organizing the approach and choosing which applications are the most relevant and useful.</p>
	                        <h3>Potential Policy Actions</h3>
	                        <p>Potential region policy actions include funding local parking analyses consistent with the regional VPP project database as well as funding parking management and pricing projects including outreach for implementation plans and capital costs.</p>
	                        <h2>(2) Policy Question – Public Perception</h2>
	                        <p><em> Under what conditions do individuals perceive parking pricing policies to be appropriate</em>
	                        </p>
	                        <h3>Question Purpose</h3>
	                        <p><em>What is the purpose of this question, why is it important, and who is the intended audience?</em>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>Civic engagement and public outreach are important, and often very challenging, elements of implementing parking policies. However, without political or public support, policies are unlikely to become successful. This answer will help policy makers at MTC, ABAG, local governments, and transit agencies better understand the perspectives of the public and better find policies that will be acceptable. The results of this analysis will offer a resource for staff to use when considering the steps needed in order to implement a new policy.</p>
	                        <p>Overview of Analysis</p>
	                        <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>In the abstract, public surveys and focus groups throughout the Bay Area in a range of different types of cities would help answer this question best. Due to limited resources, research and outreach examples, findings from surveys that have been conducted in recent years that include stated-preference responses to policy questions are reviewed. Additionally, the research to address this question includes successful examples from local jurisdictions who have successfully worked with the public to implement a pricing policy.</p>
	                        <h2>Background &amp; Research</h2>
	                        <h4>Literature Review:</h4>
	                        <p>Best Practice: Research from MTC’s Choosing Where We Live</p>
	                        <p>MTC’s <em>Choosing Where We Live</em> can help pinpoint the areas and demographics where parking pricing policies may be seen more favorable. The research surveys households looking for new housing in the Bay Area, and describes the interests of various market segments. Market segments that placed more emphasis on walkability, transit access and neighborhood quality, and placed less emphasis on driving and parking convenience, are likely to be more easily attracted to TOD. 38% of respondents—“Transit-Preferring,” “Urban Double-Income No Kids,” and “Young Brainiacs”—are within market segment groups that are more easily attracted to TODs and own one or fewer vehicles on average.</p>
	                        <p>This research can be used to apply strategies to attract target market segments. By considering specific conditions that transit-preferring market segments (such as travel minimization, service frequency, and walkscore), particular policies that support those characteristics can be focused on.</p>
	                        <p>Best Practice: MTC 2012 Parking Initiative</p>
	                        <p>In 2012, MTC gathered a panel of parking experts including developers, cities, transit agencies, academics, parking consultants and regional agencies. This panel was part of a multimedia project that included videos and posters that used compelling animations and visual graphics to promote discussions about parking reform and pricing policies. This effort won several awards from the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in 2013 annual meeting for its success in communication policy solutions (Parking Policy for Smart Growth, 2012).</p>
	                        <p>Best Practice: Public Outreach</p>
	                        <p>Policy Application: goBerkeley Public Outreach</p>
	                        <p>The City of Berkeley’s goBerkeley pilot program (discussed in detail in Policy Question 7), included an extensive outreach and marketing component. One element of this outreach included a survey to employees who stated willingness to try alternative modes of travel to get to work. Outreach targeted these businesses and included face-to-face interviews to gather information about barriers to using those alternative modes. This allowed goBerkeley staff to create plans that provided resources for alternative mode usage that specifically addressed employee’s needs.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Employee Travel Demand Management Benefits that goBerkeley will provide includes free AC Transit bus passes and discounted car-share memberships.</p>
	                        <p>In addition to providing incentives to employees, the goBerkeley program took special effort to communicate the advantages of parking pricing to business owners. Parking in Downtown Berkeley during peak evening periods was very difficult to find. Because City staff clearly communicated that demand-based pricing and time-limit restrictions would make it easier for customers to find parking as well as increase the number of visitors by increasing the turnover of the most convenient on-street spaces, the goBerkeley program was able to gather support from many local business owners.</p>
	                        <p>Policy Application: San Mateo’s Intercept Surveys and Community Outreach</p>
	                        <p>The City of San Mateo’s outreach process in 2013 is a good example showing that when the purpose of pricing policies are clearly communicated, support for these policies often increase substantially. In May 2013, the City of San Mateo conducted community outreach to understand how individuals are responding to current parking conditions. After explaining that price increases would increase availability, the survey found high support (over 50%) for increases in on-street pricing. Overall, the attitudes expressed during the stakeholder and public outreach meetings &#8212; where an effort was made to explain the concepts behind parking demand management and how pricing and enforcement effect people’s behavior and the supply of parking – were generally supportive of market-based pricing.</p>
	                        <p>Policy Application: Vallejo Park and Ride Survey Analysis</p>
	                        <p>Vallejo’s Curtola Park and Ride Facility’s Parking Management Plan is an example of a local best practice showing that even small-scale studies can be very informative in gathering information about conditions where users are willing to pay for parking. In July 2013, intercept surveys were conducted to evaluate pricing and amenities within the Curtola Park and Ride facilities. The survey found that 66% of parkers were willing to pay a daily fee to use the lot. Additionally, there was a high demand for additional amenities, with 72% of respondents supporting on-site security patrol with 45% of these respondents willing to pay for this service. If parking pricing were to be enacted, the survey found that Clipper-enabled pay stations were very a popular payment method among users.</p>
	                        <p>Best Practice: Parking Benefit Districts</p>
	                        <p>One successful public outreach tool that can help individuals understand the benefit of parking pricing policies is Parking Benefit Districts (and Business Improvement Districts, BIDs). Parking Benefit Districts can be used as an economic development, business development, and public outreach tool to use parking revenues to directly improve the people and businesses around the specific area where the parking revenues were collected. Because the funds are going directly to back to the area, such a pricing program is more transparent, increasing public support. Funds collected from public parking can be used to improve sidewalks, landscaping, and other aesthetic amenities. Alternatively, funds can be used to decrease the automobile dependence for employees by offering free transit, or eco-passes, to employees who work in the district. This will not only save employees the cost of parking, but will free up available spaces for customers. Overall, such a policy reduces the demand for parking, which will reduce the need to construct new and costly parking garages as a commercial district becomes more popular.</p>
	                        <p>Policy Application: “Old Pasadena’s” Parking District</p>
	                        <p>In 1993, the historic district of Pasadena, California has used funds from parking meters to revitalize the neighborhood, supporting visitors and businesses alike. One reason behind the on-street pricing was to increase turnover in front of store fronts so that parking would more likely be used by short-term users rather than long-term parkers such as employees. The residents and store owners of Old Pasadena were much supportive of the program when they were offered a dedicated funding source that could be invested directly back into street furniture, historic light fixtures, and regular maintenance. As the improvements brought more visitors to the area resulting in the need for increased maintenance, the demand for parking raised prices, bringing in more money to keep up with increased demand. All the while, businesses benefited from increased sales.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>Expert Analysis</p>
	                        <p>A panel of parking experts—including Donald Shoup, Elizabeth Deakin, Todd Litman, and Meea Kang—were interviewed and asked to give their experiences relating to this policy question. Each expert was asked ‘What can local jurisdictions do to increase community support for local changes to parking requirements?’ A summary of responses relating to public perception is given below.</p>
	                        <p>Local Perception Input – Expert Donald Shoup</p>
	                        <p>You will never get people to say they want to pay for parking and that it is a good idea, but you can convince people they want to charge for parking. Offer neighborhoods a ‘parking benefit district’ where you install meters and the revenue from those meters funds sidewalk repairs, installation of historic street furniture, graffiti removal, and other things the neighborhood wants then people will consider it. Old Pasadena was the first place to do this program. You cannot talk about pricing parking without thinking about what happens to the revenue. If you communicate your commitment to using that revenue to fund public services on those streets you will get more support. New technology also allows you to give residents a discount at those parking meters (i.e. Miami Beach, Monterey).</p>
	                        <p>Local Perception Input – Expert Elizabeth Deakin</p>
	                        <p>If you spend parking revenue on things that benefit the people in the town that will make a huge difference. Complete Streets policies are something that could use more money in California. UCB graduate students did surveys for City of Oakland’s Temescal neighborhood regarding the Complete Streets project for Telegraph Avenue – merchants were concerned customers would be driven away. What they found was the majority of customers were actually residents of the area, more people were walking or taking transit to the area, and those people were spending more money than the customers that drove to the area. So focusing on offering free parking in a business area may actually give you less money in some places. We are going to study this in other areas and we will see if the data continues to show that. When we work with other cities (Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco) to study who is actually shopping in the area and how do they get there we routinely find that merchants believe if we alter the parking people will stop coming to the area. Yet what we find is the people driving to the area and taking up parking are not spending the most amount of money, but instead it is the local area residents who are walking, bicycling, etc. and making repeated trips that are spending the most money. I encourage every city to study how people are arriving to their business areas.</p>
	                        <p>Parklets may generate more business than free street parking. We are hoping to do a University/City of Berkeley partnership study of this on Solano Avenue and test the results of parklets being proposed.</p>
	                        <p>Do not over react to the idea that parking supply is so critical. Spending your money on things that make your city a better place or more livable city will get you a lot farther.</p>
	                        <p>Local Perception Input – Expert Todd Litman</p>
	                        <p>Where did Don Draper end up at the end of Mad Men? California! It is time to fire a few engineers and hire more marketing professionals to sell the benefits of parking management. Redefine the issues to highlight the benefits of affordable infill housing with reduced parking requirements and make paying directly rather than indirectly for parking seem attractive.</p>
	                        <p>It really is more economically efficient and equitable to manage parking efficiently. Whether you are considering strategic objectives, such as traffic congestion, air quality, building more affordable housing, we could be doing much better by applying the strategies we are discussing. It is up to us to apply a new paradigm and reframe the questions being asked about parking.</p>
	                        <p>We have positive stories about the effectiveness and benefits of the results – Pasadena, Vallejo, good case studies from non-profit organizations. We actually have positive stories to tell. How well are we doing in sharing this information to the public? Not well, and we need to do much better.</p>
	                        <p>Local Policy Input – Expert Meea Kang</p>
	                        <p>Pursue parking pilot programs because it helps us experiment with different options. There is no one size fits all and pilots allow you to customize and try new approaches. We often wait for the “perfect” solution instead of trying “good” options and seeing what happens. We need to take the first step. There is enough academic research and regional support with MTC and ABAG, to start pilot programs. We have a fear of change and we need to take that first step and see what happens. New York City ran pilot programs to experiment with regaining public spaces for pedestrians and cyclists by removing or streamlining areas to cars, such as Times Square, etc.</p>
	                        <p>John Caner/Downtown Berkeley Association</p>
	                        <p>In addition to the panel of parking experts, Downtown Berkeley Association president John Caner spoke about his experiences with the Berkeley Value Pricing Pilot project. His experiences, as stated during the Project’s expert panel, are described below:</p>
	                        <p>The business community was skeptical of the goBerkeley Program (a Value Pricing Pilot project in Berkeley, CA). We initially thought it was an opportunity to increase prices and limit parking. We were thrilled when we worked with the goBerkeley team to learn the pilot focused on value priced parking and rationing and allocating a scarce resource. The main highlights were:</p>
	                        <ul>
	                            <li>Parking demand management shifted people from the premium to the value areas opening spaces up in the inner areas.</li>
	                            <li>Keeping it simple – by simplifying policies, improved signage, robust communication and outreach – we did not get one complaint.</li>
	                        </ul>
	                        <h3>Challenges</h3>
	                        <p><em>What (if any) impediments inhibit our ability to answer the question entirely?</em>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>Surveys relating to this question are based on stated-preference answers and include several biases. Stated preferences may not be accurately aligned with a user’s actual reaction to an implemented policy. Locational biases due to specific data collection areas do not allow for a representative sample of respondents. Additionally, attitudes are highly varied by demographics, location and lifestyle choices and they also change over time. Challenges in gathering data from local City staff and professionals arise due to time lapses between interviews and the potential change in circumstances from when the originally interviewed individual dealt with the policy issues.</p>
	                        <h3>Potential Policy Actions</h3>
	                        <p>Potential policies actions to address this question include establishing Parking Benefit Districts, developing and implementing an ongoing regional and /or local outreach and education program to explain the reasoning behind managing parking and addressing common questions. Another action is to expand the regional parking database to include an outlet that encourage the sharing of resources between communities to spread best practice methods for communicating parking pricing policies.</p>
	                        <h2>(3) Policy Question – Specific Approaches to Parking Policies</h2>
	                        <p><em>What are the specific approaches to parking pricing programs and the components that are most important for a successful program</em>
	                        </p>
	                        <h3>Question Purpose</h3>
	                        <p><em>What is the purpose of this question, why is it important, and who is the intended audience?</em>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>This question will provide guidance for MTC, ABAG, cities, and transit agencies in developing policies and programs. Understanding the specific approaches and components that are most important will support the answers to Policy Question #8, Policy Question #9 and Policy Question #10 to provide a range of information agencies may need in order to assess how pricing policies will relate to different contexts. Together, these three questions will address:</p>
	                        <ol>
	                            <li>Under what conditions policies are enacted;</li>
	                            <li>Where these conditions exist in the Bay Area; and</li>
	                            <li>The approaches and components that are more important for a successful program.</li>
	                        </ol>
	                        <h3>Overview of Analysis</h3>
	                        <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>In the abstract, an extensive inventory of parking pricing policies and the approaches and components that led to those policies becoming successful would be collected to answer this question. For the VPP Parking Project, the question is answered with background research of select successful applications. A synthesis of the expert panel analysis—included in Policy Question #3, #4, #6, #7, and #9—also contribute to this question. The majority of this research is completed within the research for the Project’s wide set of policy questions. The policy applications describing successful parking pricing policies in this report include analysis in order to gain an understanding of exactly what led to its success (or prevented its success).</p>

	                        <p>Parking Technology</p>
	                        <p>Technological solutions can help cities manage resources and implement pricing policies more efficiently. In addition to parking technologies such as pay stations and dynamic wayfinding signage, some parking technologies do not include costly infrastructure. For example, an online permit purchasing system can be more convenient for the user and also reduce labor needs for administrators. Permit holders can set up accounts to renew daily monthly permit pass purchases. Email reminders or information notices and changes can be sent out to permit holders. Additionally, waitlists systems for permit holders can be smoothly administered.</p>
	                        <ul>
	                            <li>Multi-space meters—including pay-by-space, pay-by-ID, pay-by-plate, and pay-and-display systems—provide one meter to collect fares for many parking spaces. Pay-by-ID and pay-by-plate systems require users to enter a unique identification number or license plate number into the payment machine. Pay-and-display spaces print a receipt that users place on their dashboard.</li>
	                        </ul>
	                        <p>Infrastructure that could use Clipper Integration includes multi-space payment machines where users type in their serial number. With a customer machine, a sensor could read the Clipper serial number on the Clipper card’s embedded chip. Not just any system can use the Clipper card as a method to pay for transportation-related services. MTC must work with the proposed project in order to ensure that it will be run smoothly, and will not compromise the Clipper brand.</p>

	                            <li>Wayfinding and parking guidance signage allows drivers to understand and navigate through a parking system with effective signage and information. Recognizable and consistent wayfinding will ensure that drivers can quickly recognize the facility as an available parking location associated with a City’s parking. A good parking signage system performs multiple functions. It provides effective information and direction for drivers to find their way to parking, communicates parking rules, and helps maintain the image of the community. Best practice examples combine branding—creating a recognizable design that represents a city—with the signage technology to create a more powerful wayfinding system.</li>

	                        <p>Demand-Dependent Pricing Structures</p>
	                        <p>Demand-based pricing can be implemented by applying higher meter prices to areas with higher demand. SFpark (detailed within the discussion for Policy Question #7) and Los Angeles’ ExpressPark program both work to implement dynamic pricing strategies, using pavement-embedded sensors to study which areas have the highest demand or locate “hotspots” of particularly high demand. Prices are then raised in high-demand locations and lowered in low-demand areas, encouraging parkers to shift towards adjacent blocks with available parking (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>

	                            </a>
	                        </p>
	                        <p class="LFTBody">While demand, supply, and a parker’s willingness to pay a certain price is not simple to measure exactly, programs that are measuring changes in demand have recognized stabilization patterns and trends that can be approximated. Therefore, raising prices on more popular streets and/or lowering prices on streets with fewer vehicles can be a feasible policy action without the costly resources required to take exact measurements throughout the day.</p>
	                        <p>Parking Taxes</p>
	                        <p>Parking taxes can be levied in a variety of ways to disincentivize parking supply and use. The economic concept behind parking taxes is that they impose some of the indirect costs of parking back on the owner and/or user of parking. Indirect costs of parking include foregone tax revenue, direct environmental effects such as runoff and urban heat island effects, and indirect environmental impacts associated with incentivizing private vehicle use.</p>
	                        <p>In some cities, a parking tax is levied on the parking charge, such as a 10% charge on the fee paid in the City of Los Angeles. This type of policy only has an effect when there is a direct payment for parking, and therefore is limited to a subset of users in primarily urban areas. It encourages the undesirable practice of bundling of parking with rents. An alternative approach is to levy a tax on the square footage of parking lots and structures. This means that the tax is paid regardless of whether there are parking charges or whether the parking is occupied. For example, Montreal Canada has instituted a parking tax of $19.80 per square meter for surface lots in the central business district and $4.95 per square meter for surface lots in suburban areas. The tax rates can be structured to disincentivize surface parking or parking areas where a strong multimodal parking program is in place. Property owners will find parking to be a less desirable use of land and therefore consider alternative uses. If parking taxes are passed on to the end user, parking demand will be reduced according to the price elasticity of demand for parking with respect to price, which generally lies between -0.1 and -0.4. Regional entities can do the legal research to identify the potential for regional parking taxes, and promote the imposition of local parking taxes.</p>
	                        <p>Tiered Pricing Structures</p>
	                        <p>Tiered pricing schemes based on per-hour charges are implemented by charging higher rates for longer time stays. Several cities within the Bay Area use tiered pricing structures to help manage parking demand. For example, San Mateo uses tiered pricing, increasing metered rates for a vehicle’s third and fourth hour.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Therefore, unlike time-limits, vehicles have the option of parking for longer periods of time, but at an increased rate. Off-street tiered pricing schemes are administered in Redwood City, where off-street public garage parking permits are charged based on permit type and location/proximity to downtown. The lower cost permits are further from the downtown and/or cover fewer hours/days of operation.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Another example is exhibited in BART parking lots. BART assesses the daily fees every six months based on occupancy counts measuring the parking lot use. If the lot is less than 95% full, the daily fee will decrease $0.50; if the parking lot is 100% full, the daily fee with increase $0.50.</p>
	                        <p>Off-street Parking Pricing</p>
	                        <p>A common problem in many areas with congested on-street parking is that vehicles will circle around looking for on-street parking rather than heading directly to unused off-street parking. Pricing strategies can be used to make off-street parking more competitive, reducing this traffic congestion and reducing unnecessary circling. Setting on-street parking prices higher relative to off-street prices can be used to manage demand for on-street parking by encouraging longer-term parkers to utilize off-street lots.</p>
	                        <p class="LFTBody">Calthrop and Proost (2006) research how drivers choose to park on-street and off-street, given relative prices. There is a balance between having to search for on-street parking and being able to park closer to one’s destination; the relative costs and parking time-restrictions of the two parking facilities also plays into the decision. Similarly, Kobus et al. (2012) used parking data to calculate the elasticity for on-street parking prices when adjacent garage parking was available. They found that higher on-street parking prices relative to off-street garages encourage longer-duration parkers to use garages. This study found strong evidence that drivers are willing to pay additional for on-street parking, with a calculated price elasticity of demand for on-street parking of -0.4.</p>

	                            <br /> An alternative to minimum parking requirements for individual businesses is allowing or requiring business owners and developers to pay in-lieu fees to fund public parking facilities or to pay for alternative access modes (for example, universal transit passes) rather than requiring them to construct their own private parking. Pasadena, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Seattle are some examples of cities where developers can pay in in-lieu fee instead of providing required parking.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[6]</a>
	                        </p>
	                        <p>In-lieu Fees</p>
	                        <p>Often, to set the in-lieu fee amount, cities either (1) determine the appropriate fee amount based on the cost of developing parking for each project, or (2) have a uniform fee or cost per space for all projects. More often, cities apply the latter based on its simplicity, and often these costs are lower than the true costs of providing the parking (Shoup, 1999). When setting in-lieu fees, planners must be cautious not to set the amount too low or too high. A fee that is too low will encourage all developers to opt-in to the program, but will not cover the costs of constructing and maintaining the amount of parking needed to accommodate demand. The level of user parking fees must also be considered in the calculation of parking demand; a decision whether or not to subsidize parking for a particular location is an important policy question that should entail consideration of options and broader costs and benefits. A fee that is too high will discourage most developers from taking advantage of the benefits of the in-lieu fee, and rather opt to build the required parking or not develop at all.</p>
	                        <p>Policy Application: In-lieu fees in Santa Monica, California</p>
	                        <p>The Third Street Promenade commercial district in Santa Monica, California (<strong>Figure 6</strong>) allows developers to pay a set a “Parking Developer Fee” of $1.50 per year per square foot of floor area in-lieu of parking. This money is used to construct and maintain public parking garages behind he stores. The result of the policy has led to many commercial uses with typically high requirements to come to the area—including movie theaters, restaurants, and shops—that draw many patrons to the district. The fee, first established in 1986, has been adequate to provide parking for the area and has also resulted in creating a vibrant and pedestrian-friendly commercial district.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[7]</a>

	                        <p>The City of Pasadena implemented an in-lieu fee program for Old Pasadena so that property owners in the area could find a way to meet the Old Pasadena’s parking requirements. Therefore, new development can make use of existing parking structures instead of meeting their parking requirements. The goal of the program was not to generate revenue, but to cover the cost of constructing parking for the residents. City staff report that approximately $330,000 per year is collected from the program.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[8]</a> As of 2012 the fee was $155.00 per space per year, and is adjusted for inflation annually.</p>
	                        <p>Policy Application: Land Banking in Palo Alto, CA</p>
	                        <p>One policy that has been used when parking need is uncertain is land banking, which puts aside the required land for parking as public space, giving the security that it is available to be converted to parking if needed. Palo Alto, CA allows reductions up to 50% of the minimum parking requirements for land banking. The California Park Apartment development, for example, was required to build 95 parking spaces by city code, but used the area for 22 of these spaces and set it aside for a communal recreational space—including a family play area, picnic benches, and a barbeque area. None of the land banked space set aside for parking in Palo Alto has yet to be needed for parking.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[9]</a>

	                        <p>Arlington County, Virginia, has enacted a Travel Demand Management (TDM) program to discourage assigned parking and maximize sharing of parking spaces. In the 2009 Comprehensive Plan, Arlington County set to limit reserved parking to less than 20% of the total supply and have identified four types of shared parking to encourage as follows:</p>
	                        <ul>
	                            <li>Complementary Hours: Shared parking within users with different peak hours of utilization</li>
	                            <li>Off-site Agreements: Parking within facilities with more spaces than required can contract to serve another user.</li>
	                            <li>Public Parking: Parking facilities with more spaces than required can open the facility to the public for use.</li>
	                            <li>Unreserved Spaces: If a parking facility does not use reserved spaces, they can accommodate additional vehicles.</li>
	                        </ul>
	                        <p>Policy Application: Shared Parking in the Portland Metropolitan Area</p>
	                        <p>The Portland Metropolitan Area has taken several steps to increase the efficiency of its land use by encouraging shared parking agreements between businesses and within districts. A few examples are included below.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[10]</a>
	                        </p>
	                        <ul>
	                            <li>The Lloyd District in Northeast Portland—a Business District consisting predominantly of offices with private parking and also the Lloyd Center mall—has added more than 1,000,000 square feet of commercial property yet reduced its total amount of parking in the last 10 years by taking advantage of shared parking agreements.</li>
	                            <li>Recognizing the different peak-demand times, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in southeast Portland has significantly reduced its on-site parking by entering into formal agreements with two local churches adjacent to the campus.</li>
	                            <li>The Parks Bureau within the City of Portland has established shared parking arrangements with private businesses, a hospital, and a college, so that visitors and residents can use the recreation park space without having to turn some of the greenspace to concrete surface lots.</li>
	                        </ul>
	                    </div>
	                    <p>Parking Trade</p>
	                    <p>One approach for shared parking includes parking trade. This allows for the retention of minimum parking requirements but allows the requirement to be fulfilled by supply within 500 feet of the project site. Shared parking facilities should be within a one-block to three-block walking distance of the proposed site (approximately 1/4 mile). Shared parking facilities may be entitled up to 1.5 spaces per off-site parking space and should be part of the conditional use permit with parking rights specified for a set period of time. This program would create incentives for new development to look for and enter agreements with existing buildings to meet their parking requirement. Furthermore, reducing the practice of dedicating parking to users, either in offices or residential, makes shared parking possible.</p>

	                    <p><em>What (if any) impediments inhibit our ability to answer the question entirely?</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>In addition to a wide range of priced policies, there are many different examples of approaches and components that have led to their success. Many of these components are too nuanced to capture in a study of the policy. The challenge to answer this question is to understand our limitations while still grasping the most important elements of each policy review. This applies to both the research and expert panel review that is used to address this question.</p>

	                        <h3>Potential Policy Actions</h3>
	                        <p>Policy actions that will address this question include increasing awareness of parking issues, policies, and actions through the Regional Parking Database as well as to support full implementation plans for cities to enact pricing programs. These plans should always include the need for pricing, a forecasts for how pricing will affect parking, an evaluation of technology options, funding, a cost and revenue analysis, and a detailed outreach initiative. Regional policy actions could be to provide funding parking analysis and implementation plans, including outreach for implementation plans and capital costs.</p>

	                    <h2>Policy Questions</h2>
	                    <p>Eleven policy questions have been developed to structure and guide the Value Pricing Pilot (VPP) regional parking project’s (“the Project”) policy analysis and best practices research. This site introduces the approach to addressing the issues raised in the Project by itemizing the eleven policy questions identified in the study, explaining its purpose, and discussing analytical, modeling, policy, and/or expert research on the topic. The methods outlined below will be used to address these policy questions throughout the Project timeline:

	                    <p>Two of the Policy Questions in the Project use modeling tools—UrbanSim and Travel Model One—to help address them. These tools have not yet been applied to parking, and the analysis for these questions include discussions on how new uses and further development of the land use and travel models allowed for further parking simulation.</p>

	                <h1 class="entry-title">Bay Area UrbanSim</h1>
	                <div class="entry-content">
	                    <p>Bay Area UrbanSim is the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s (MTC’s) regional land use model. The model is used to analyze how planning policies affect the location choices of households, businesses, and real estate developers over the long term (i.e, 20 to 30 years). Typical analyses include: assessing changes in development patterns due to proposed changes in policies such as zoning or urban limit lines; assessing the spatial and economic results of housing subsidies or fees; and assessing shifts in development patterns due to transportation investments. The system simultaneously examines the impacts of both land use and transportation policies and investments in an integrated and consistent manner.</p>
	                    <p>A simple parking policy such as reduction or elimination of minimum parking requirements per unit is examined in Bay Area UrbanSim by lowering the costs associated with building a typical residential project, but placing a value on parking spaces as an independent unit feature. Future year simulations would then be used to assess the degree to which this policy increases housing affordability and shifts development to infill locations. This analysis assumes that households would accept housing bundled with less parking and a lower overall housing cost. As information is gathered, the UrbanSim database could also provide insight into alternative parking locations (e.g., street parking) that a household might shift to if it allowed lower housing costs. A major limitations to successful analysis with Bay Area UrbanSim stem from the difficulty in simulating user demand for less parking or no parking as well as the value of a parking space for different market segments.</p>

	                <h1 class="entry-title">Travel Model One</h1>
	                <div class="entry-content">
	                    <p>Travel Model One is the name given to the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s (MTC’s) regional travel demand model. The model is used for a wide array of analyses, generally done in the context of long range (i.e., 20 to 30 years) planning. Typical analyses include the following: assessing the performance of proposed transportation infrastructure projects; assessing the likely air quality and greenhouse gas impacts of long-range land use and transportation plans; and, assessing the likely impact of myriad transport-related policies, including roadway pricing and expanded transit service.</p>
	                    <p>The travel model explicitly represents the impact of parking prices and parking subsidies on location and mode choice decisions. This allows analysts to assess the regional impacts of policies that increase (or decrease) parking prices, such as mandated reductions in supply, or expose more (or fewer) travelers to parking prices through changes in employer-provided subsidy regulations.</p>
	                    <p>The regional nature of the tool leaves it ill-suited to inform policy debates about smaller-scale or more-nuanced parking policies that are often effective at changing behavior. For example, the travel model exposes travelers only to the cost of parking, not the difficulty in obtaining parking. It may be that many users would gladly pay more for a reserved (or likely available) spot. Further, the model’s representations of space and land use are fairly coarse, leaving it unable to comment on the ability of proximate businesses to share parking or to differentiate between a discount grocer and a Whole Foods market.</p>

	                    </p>
	                    <p>This is a fundamental question that addresses the relationship between parking supply, demand, and pricing. This question is of prime interest to MTC and ABAG. Local jurisdictions are primarily interested in the answers to these questions within their own jurisdictions. This question is especially dependent on parking economics. Each specific location will have its own balance of supply, demand, and price elasticity that will determine how a set price affects the relationship between supply and demand. Factors affect supply and demand are location-dependent—including demographics, transportation options in the area, local and regional policies, as well as culture. <strong>Figure 1</strong> illustrates the relationships between parking demand, supply and price.</p>

	                    <p>Data analysis methods for this question can be used by local jurisdictions for development of strategies, to begin larger discussions on parking management, or as a starting point for a larger study. Supply and occupancy data can establish a baseline for comparative analysis, allowing local jurisdictions to evaluate how the relationship between parking supply, demand, and price in their jurisdiction compares to the larger region.</p>
	                    <h3>Overview of Analysis</h3>
	                    <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>In the abstract, we would address this question by analyzing a complete data set of parking inventory, occupancy, turnover, and pricing throughout the region and for all times of day, days of week, and seasons. Information for all parking—both private and public supplies—would allow a full supply and demand analysis. Additionally, before and after data showing user responses to parking price changes would make it possible to calculate the price elasticity of demand, which would allow the project to determine what price could be charged for parking in order to achieve desired occupancy levels.</p>
	                    <p>In this study, this question is addressed primarily through new analysis of new data collected on supply, occupancy, and price of public parking facilities for 25 locations throughout the Bay Area.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This information is location-specific so that demand by area is correlated with a high-level summary of the policy, demographic, transit service and/or land use characteristics that makes each area unique. In addition to analyzing occupancy by region, GIS is used to map findings spatially and look at which parking conditions are common throughout the Bay Area (<strong>Figure 2)</strong>.</p>

	                    </p>
	                    <p>The data collection for this project that is used to address this question includes parking inventory and occupancy for 25 study areas. Inventory (including price and restrictions) and occupancy of public parking (on- and off-street) for one (1) weekday (Monday-Thursday) and one (1) weekend (Saturday) during five (5) times of the day: 5AM, 9AM, 12PM, 4PM, and 8PM. The results are also discussed in relationship to the parking policies within each study area.</p>

	                    <p>Professor Donald Shoup, an expert on parking economics, suggests keeping prices consistent with an occupancy level of approximately 85% in order to realize the “right price” for parking.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a> “Underpriced and overcrowded curb parking creates problems for everyone except a few lucky drivers who find a cheap space,” Shoup explains in the introduction to his research on demand based pricing in San Francisco (2013). Additionally, while underpricing and overcrowding creates problems, overpricing and under-crowded spaces also have negative effects.</p>
	                    <p>For areas with more supply than demand, unused parking spaces could be converted to more efficient land uses (such as developments, public space, or parklets); excess (underutilized) parking in these areas could also be used by adjacent high-demand areas by implementing shared parking policies or valet parking policies (see Policy Question #7-11 for application descriptions). Additional literature relating to this balancing of supply, demand through pricing policies include:</p>

	                    <p>Several studies have researched how parking prices change demand, calculating price elasticity of demand for different regions. The change in demand due to changes in price is also dependent on supply. Because of this, effects of changes in price on demand are very location-specific. Price elasticity of demand found in cities around the world range from -0.15 to -0.58 from a variety of research, including:</p>

	                    <p>New York City received an FHWA grant to implement demand-based variable pricing. The conditions that led to the program’s initiation were a high rate of cruising for parking, low availability of parking during peak demand periods, and a high rate of double parking. Within Greenwich Village, pricing was raised from $1 to $2 during the peak demand period from noon to 4pm. Occupancy on weekdays decreased about 8% on weekdays and vehicle turnover increased, allowing a higher number of total vehicles to park. Results of the 6-month pilot were well documented and success of the program resulted in continuing the variable pricing policy, raising the fees to $2/hour off-peak and $3/hour during peak periods.</p>

	                        <a name="_Toc389490424"></a>Policy Application: Berkeley’s goBerkeley Pilot</p>
	                    <p>In 2013, with funding from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the City of Berkeley initiated a pilot program that implemented several on-street dynamic pricing strategies. Hourly rates for on-street parking range from $1.00 to $2.25; prices were set based on the demand for parking in the area. In Berkeley’s Elmwood District, a popular commercial corridor with limited on-street parking, a tiered-parking strategy was implemented to encourage short-term parking and discourage longer-term parking. Prices start at $1.00 and increase $0.50 for every additional hour of stay, up to three hours. Pilots were also initiated in the Downtown Berkeley and Southside/Telegraph neighborhoods. In these areas premium and value areas were established. The higher demand premium areas had shorter time limits and higher hourly rates to encourage turnover, and lower demand value areas had longer time limits and lower hourly rates.</p>
	                    <p>Off-street lots are commonly priced higher than on-street parking, resulting in underutilized off-street parking and excess demand (including double parking) within on-street parking in high demand areas. Off-street parking typically needs to be less expensive to encourage longer term parking, increasing availability of on-street parking for short-term parking. In 2013, Berkeley found that the $0.50/hour higher cost for on-street parking (at $1.50/hour) compared to off-street costs (at $1.00/hour) was not sufficient to encourage parkers to use off-street facilities over on-street facilities. Even with this price differential, on-street parking was still consistently above 85% occupied while off-street facilities were before 75% occupied. This study resulted in recommendations that the pilot implement addition pricing measures to make off-street parking more competitive with on-street parking.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[4]</a>

	                    <p>With funding from the FHWA in 2011, San Francisco began an ambitious program to set on-street parking prices at variable levels dependent on the demand for that area. Seven pilot zones were selected to have demand-based pricing, with prices adjusted every few weeks based on occupancy rates. For example, if occupancy rates are below 30%, the price is decreased by 50 cents per hour; if occupancy is above 80%, the price is increased 25 cents per hour (<strong>Figure 3</strong>).</p>

	                    <p class="LFTBody">There are several benefits of the SFpark program. First, vehicles spend less time circling for parking. This reduces traffic congestion and decreases emissions from excess driving. Second, drivers parked in the areas of higher demand will typically park for a shorter time, increasing turnover rate and therefore, making these spaces available to accommodate more people. Last, more people may use alternative modes and carpool to highly demanded destinations with the highest prices, such as baseball games at AT&amp;T Park.</p>
	                    <p class="LFTBody">Pierce and Shoup (2013) calculated the price elasticity of demand based on SFPark data of 5,294 changes in price and occupancy within San Francisco. Overall, over the course of the study, meter prices did not increase overall—meters were adjusted both up and down with the average meter price falling 1%. The average elasticity value calculated was -0.4. Therefore, as the cost for parking increased by $1, occupancy fell by 40%. In other words, on a street block-face with 10 spaces, raising the price by 25 cents will open up one parking space.</p>
	                    <p>After the program had been in effect for six months, Pierce and Shoup (2013) looked at two of the seven pilot areas to calculate the price elasticity of demand based on SFPark’s data showing price and occupancy changes in 2012. The study found that the price elasticity of demand in an area at Fisherman’s wharf was -1.3. Here, demand for parking was low (average occupancy at 27%) and prices were decreased to reach higher occupancies. For every $1 decrease in price per hour, occupancy increased 130% (<strong>Table 2</strong>). Even though per-hour prices decreased, the parking revenue for the Beach Street area increased, because occupancy increased substantially.</p>

	                    <p>Data was collected for 25 sites in the Bay Area to look at parking supply, occupancy, and pricing. This analysis is to be completed summer, 2015.</p>

	                    </p>
	                    <p>There are several impediments to data collection and analysis that inhibit our ability to answer this question entirely.</p>
	                    <ol>
	                        <li>Due to limited resources, data collection is limited to 25 new sites, rather than being able to collect data throughout the Bay Area. Locations are biased towards areas with high demand as well as areas where transit-accessible areas. These limit the generalizability of the findings from the specific locations.</li>
	                        <li>Data collection was completed between August 2014 and February 2015. Therefore, data collection did not occur for all time periods or all seasons, limiting the generalizability of the findings to a few representative times.</li>
	                        <li>It is challenging to collect supply and use data for private off street parking; in some places this type of parking is a major component of the total parking supply and this gap should be recognized in the development of findings. While some collections do include some private off-street facilities, most collections include only on-street and public off-street facilities.</li>

	                    <p><span style="color:#000080;"><em>1. Policy Question: What would be the impact of reduced parking requirements on distribution and types of new development in different areas of the region? </em></span>
	                    </p>
	                    <h3>Question Purpose</h3>
	                    <p><em>What is the purpose of this question, why is it important, and who is the intended audience?</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>Typical parking requirements subsidize driving, increasing drive-alone mode shares and act as a barrier to Smart Growth. Rigid parking requirements—especially those that are high—can prevent development or incentivize development in low-density areas where land costs are cheaper. Standard uniform parking requirements disproportionately dampen urban development because of higher land values in urban areas compared with suburban locations. In residential areas, the cost of building parking is passed on to the resident, increasing housing costs for all users, regardless of car ownership. Altogether, this research can help inform how parking requirements affect the cost and location of development in the Bay Area.</p>
	                    <p>This information can help local governments and regional governments in developing appropriate land use and transportation policies. Local governments can benefit from this information to better understand the local land use implications of their parking policies. The regional agencies are interested in this information to help develop effective policies that provide residents with more choices in how they live and access their needs, and that support implementation of the development patterns envisioned in the regional plan, Plan Bay Area. Plan Bay Area emphasizes additional development in the larger cities and along transit corridors, particularly in priority development areas (PDAs) in part to address housing and greenhouse goals. In the long run this information and subsequent policy changes are expected to benefit residents who desire housing with less parking, through reduced costs for housing.</p>
	                    <h3>Overview of Analysis</h3>
	                    <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>In the abstract, we would like to analyze the economics of developments and their parking requirements throughout the region, and the size of the market for various types of housing and transportation choices. In addition, before and after data of all commercial and residential development that have implemented reduced or eliminated parking requirements, would be useful in order to focus on the real-life impact of parking requirement policies. However, timing for such types of applications is very specific; therefore, research for this question will include an analysis of research and applications as well as modeling reduced and eliminated parking requirement scenarios through UrbanSim.</p>
	                    <p>UrbanSim was used to estimate the impact of parking policies on future patterns of development based on demographic trends, emerging behavior patterns, real estate finances, transportation costs, etc. Cost of building parking as well as the current parking requirements was be incorporated into UrbanSim’s real-estate model; the model then simulated the cost savings to developments when parking requirements are reduced. Simulations show the affect that reductions to this cost, based on reduced requirements, would have on a developer’s choice to build.</p>

	                    <p>In “High Cost of Free Parking”, Donald Shoup (2005) argues that in order to avoid subsidizing the cost of driving with free parking; parking should be viewed as a commodity like any space rental. While research is scarce, this research accumulates data from two separate studies to look at how providing free parking by way of parking requirements can (1) increase the construction costs per dwelling by 18%, (2) decreases housing density by 30%, and (3) decrease land value 32-33%. Altogether, this work discusses how parking requirements make development more expensive and discourage high density development while encouraging sprawl. Additional studies looking at the effect of reduced parking requirements include:</p>

	                        <li>“Turning Housing into Driving: Parking Requirements and Density in Los Angeles and New York,” (Manville, Beata, and Shoup, 2013) looks at how parking requirements decrease density and increase automobile ownership. In New York City, the researchers found that for every 10% increase in minimum parking requirements, there was a 6% reduction in both population and housing density, and a 5% increase in the number of vehicles per square mile.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[2]</u></a>

This research discusses how minimum requirements increase demand for automobiles, by providing a parking supply beyond what the market would naturally provide and spreading out land uses making it more difficult to get places with alternative modes.

	                    </p>
	                    <p>This recent study of 12 TOD residential properties in Santa Clara County (2010) found that there was substantial unused parking at all of the sites, which had been built to the local parking requirements.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[3]</u></a> It concludes that as such, many Santa Clara County municipalities could reduce their residential parking requirements significantly without the risk of “underparking” a TOD residential site. The estimated cost of the 2,496 unused parking spaces counted in the study for these sites represent about $37.4 million in opportunity cost. Such studies can help inform decision-makers as well as the public that areas near transit stations are often over-parked. This parking can be reduced and converted to other kinds of development projects, further supporting transit ridership.</p>

	                    <p>In 2006, San Francisco eliminated parking requirements for housing in downtown commercial (C-3) zoning districts and has instead replaced these with maximum parking requirements of 1 parking space for every 4 housing units. These policies have been implemented along with car-sharing, secure bicycle parking and unbundling policies (further detailed in Policy Question #4). Successful application of these policies resulted in extending these policies—including maximum requirements and unbundled parking—to several new neighborhoods.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[5]</u></a>

	                    <p>Inclusion of parking in to housing costs raises the cost of housing. There have been a number of analyses of the impact of the inclusion of parking on housing costs.</p>
	                    <p>In a report by Jia and Wachs (1998), an economic analysis investigated the impact on housing affordability of code required parking in six neighborhoods in San Francisco. Using hedonic pricing it estimated that parking increased prices by about 10%. Based on the findings it recommends a rethinking of these parking code requirements so that housing is more affordable, particularly for lower income households.</p>
	                    <p>The Bay Area Council Poll in 2014 found that 79% of those polled (in all nine San Francisco Bay Area counties) said that the Bay Area faces “crisis in housing costs.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><u>[6]</u></a> Inclusion of parking increases the cost of building housing, limiting the amount of housing that can be produced under a set budget. Demand for more affordable housing in the Bay Area is sky-high, resulting in long waiting lists. The following studies specifically look at how minimum requirements affect affordable housing:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>The study, <em>Parking Utilization in Affordable Housing </em>in San Diego, CA (Willson, O’Connor, and Hajjiri, 2012) looks at housing affordability and parking demand and finds that demand for parking is lower than the built supply and assessing the policies that will cause individuals to determine whether vehicle ownership is worth the cost. The study found that demand for parking in affordable housing rental units was approximately half that of market rate rental units in San Diego. Furthermore, there was a direct relationship between parking demand and income level. In several affordable and senior housing developments in San Diego, data collection showed that utilization rates were only a small proportion of the minimum requirements under code.</li>
	                    </ul>
	                    <p>Due to lower car ownership rates within low-income groups, parking in affordable housing developments often go unused, yet the requirements still increase the rental costs. “Parking Requirement Impacts on Housing Affordability,” (Litman, 2013) estimates that a single parking space increases the price of a housing unit by 12.5%. Demand can be influenced by household income, tenure, household size, population density and alternative transportation, as well as pricing policies. Despite lower demand in many areas with more transit options and lower-income populations, parking requirements are typically set at the same rate for all housing.</p>

	                    <p>The Adaptive Reuse Ordinance (ARO), passed in the City of Los Angeles in 1999, was created to encourage the conversion and reuse of vacant commercial buildings as residential apartments in downtown Los Angeles. In order to encourage residential reuse of older, often abandoned, office buildings, the City both reduced the parking requirements and allowed off-site facilities to satisfy these lower requirements. A study of the ARO buildings by Shoup and Manville (2007) found that these developers made more efficient use of fewer spots by unbundling the parking, and reducing the overall demand for spaces by tenants. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[7]</u></a>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>“Parking Requirements and Housing Affordability” (Jia and Wachs, 1999) looks at reduced parking requirements in downtown L.A. This study finds that with reduced requirements, developers provide more housing overall as well as a variety of housing for different types of household sizes and incomes.

It gives several examples in North America of where and how this tool has been used, including:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>Rather than an in-lieu fee, Aspen Colorado allowed the developers of residential units in the new Visitor’s Center to contribute funds to carsharing.</li>
	                        <li>The City of Seattle has modified its Land Use Code to allow required residential spaces to be dedicated for car-sharing use.</li>
	                        <li>Austin, Texas has modified its code to allow parking reductions for multi-family developments that participate in car-sharing within the University Neighborhood Overlay district.</li>
	                        <li>The City of Vancouver in Canada allows a single car-sharing space to substitute for up to three required parking spaces within multi-family buildings of 30 units or more.</li>
	                    </ul>
	                    <p>Additionally, some developments have started offering a portion of their units without parking and at a lower cost. “Moda,” a condo development in downtown Seattle, offered lower-priced units for 83 of the 251 units that do not provide parking. The demand was so high for units without parking that they sold out in less than a week.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[9]</u></a> Similarly, The Civic in Portland, OR offered 25 lower-cost units without parking.</p>
	                    <p><strong>Reduced and Flexible Parking Requirements</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>Parking requirements are sometimes reduced on a case-by-case basis, but few cities have policies written into their code. Requiring flexible parking requirements, reduced parking requirements for development near transit, or setting regional parking requirement maximums would allow regional agencies to manage parking supply by having an indirect effect on the price of development due to parking.</p>

	                    <p>The Right Size Parking Calculator is a tool to help determine how much residential parking is required for new developments, with demand factors that are specific to the King County region. The motivation behind the Right Size Parking Project was the understanding that parking is often oversupplied due to minimum parking requirements and the methods of estimating parking needs that are based on suburban vehicle ownership rates do not apply well to the area. The project found that residences in the area built an average of 1.4 spaces per dwelling unit, despite only needing approximately 1 space per dwelling unit. This is a large and wasteful cost to developers; it also represents a barrier towards Smart Growth and TOD principles. Therefore, the calculator is a tool to help inform context-specific parking demand, rather than relying on demand information that may not be relevant to the King County area.</p>
	                    <p>The Right Size Calculator works to estimate the number of parking spaces per residential unit (parking/unit ratio) for specific new developments and location characteristics. Therefore, the “right size” number of parking spaces per unit depends on the characteristics of the location and specifics of the development—such as the price of the development, location of jobs, transit access. The model also outputs estimated “parking impacts,” providing average construction costs, vehicle miles traveled, and greenhouse gas emissions that the amount of parking will provide (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Last, the model outputs estimates for trip generation reduction based on commute distance and journey to work mode split, data gathered from the U.S. Census.</p>
	                    <p>The Calculator was created by first collecting parking-use data from hundreds of multi-family residential developments. A regression analysis was used to build the model based on characteristics of each residential building (such as average rent, units per square feet, and occupancy) as well as environmental characteristics (such as measure of transit service and population/job density). These variables were used to predict the demand for parking based on the dependent data: “observed vehicles per occupied residential unit.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[10]</u></a>

	                    <p>UrbanSim was used to model reduction or elimination of minimum parking requirements over a 15-year simulation period to analyze a forecast for the location and type of development throughout the region in that timeframe. The implementation was designed in such a way that the assumptions can be adjusted and simulations rerun to analyze the sensitivity of development to changes in parking requirements. Three simulations are modeled, including:</p>
	                    <ol>
	                        <li>A baseline scenario where parking requirements are set to a reasonable approximation of current parking requirements in the region,</li>
	                        <li>A reduced requirement scenario where parking minimum requirements are halved within Transit Priority Areas (TPAs) and remain constant outside TPAs, and</li>
	                        <li>An eliminated requirement scenario where parking minimum requirements are set to zero within Transit Priority Areas (TPAs) and remain constant outside TPAs.</li>
	                    </ol>
	                    <p><strong>Methodology </strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p><em>Data</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>There is an existing UrbanSim implementation in the Bay Area, which was developed for the 2014 Bay Area regional plan – Plan Bay Area – and associated Environmental Impact Report. For the existing implementation, the necessary parcel, building, household, and employment data are already available. Existing model specifications for residential and non-residential prices, as well as household and employment location choice models are also available. As the next Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for the Bay Area is due in 2017, and UrbanSim is slated be a key component in testing alternative land use scenarios for the new plan, these model configurations are still subject to change for the next policy implementation.</p>
	                    <p><em>Parking Requirement Assumptions</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>Parking requirements are defined for either residential, industrial, office, or retail building types. Parking requirements are per unit for residential uses and per 1000 square feet for non-residential uses. Current parking requirement assumptions for the “no project” scenario are specified based on parking requirement data for 51 cities within the Bay Area. Using the data from these 51 cities, the mean upper-minimum parking requirements for each land use type are used to create a reasonable default to represent regional average parking requirements (with the exception of San Francisco, where requirements are set lower). These averages are rounded to the nearest 0.5 spaces. Therefore, region-wide parking requirements are 3.0 spaces per residential unit (for San Francisco 1.0 spaces per residential unit); 4.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet of retail space; and 4.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of office space.</p>
	                    <p>With these assumptions, parking requirements will vary by building type but not by jurisdiction (with the exception of the City of San Francisco, where parking requirements were specific to the City). If data on minimum parking requirements improves in the future, parking requirements can be specific to jurisdictions or even within jurisdictions, as the UrbanSim simulation is entirely parcel-based (with residential unit level representation also available). For now, data collection is insufficient to claim parcel-level understanding of parking requirements throughout the Bay Area. Setting the parking requirements to reasonable defaults means the assumptions can be simply and transparently communicated, and eliminates any bias that might exist to the locations for which we do know the actual parking requirements.</p>
	                    <p><em>Scenarios</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>The assumptions specified by building type and density were applied to all proposed developments in the region. The modeling process includes a baseline “no project” simulation for comparison. The second scenario will reduce parking requirements by half within TPAs, and for the third scenario parking requirements will be reduced to zero. TPAs are used as the basic geography for reduction of parking requirements, as a reasonable assumption is that parking requirements cannot be reduced without meeting transportation demand with some other mode, most likely transit and non-motorized modes in the dense built environments around transit hubs.</p>
	                    <p><strong>Summary of Results</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>The relative amount of growth within areas where minimum parking requirements were reduced in TPAs was calculated in order to interpret the impact of change in minimum parking requirements in the simulations. The results of the scenarios are summarized by a metric representing the percentage of residential and non-residential <em>growth</em> in built space inside and outside of TPAs in the next 15 years. In other words, given that population and job growth is assumed to be constant across scenarios, the number of net residential units and net job spaces is roughly constant across scenarios as well. The simple metric of how much of that growth falls within TPAs for each of the three scenarios is a first estimate at the global impact of the reduction in parking on changes on the built environment. These simple summaries are provided below in Table 4.</p>
	                    <p>The baseline model predicts that 73.2 percent of residential growth and 60.0 percent of non-residential growth will occur in TPAs throughout the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area region. When parking requirements are reduced by one-half, the amount of residential growth within the TPAs increases by 3.0 percent; non-residential growth within the TPAs increases by 5.2 percent. Similarly, when requirements are completely eliminated, both residential and non-residential growth within the TPAs increase by 4.8 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively. The reduction in built space due to reducing requirements by one-half has an incrementally larger impact relative to eliminating parking requirements, suggesting there might be a small nonlinear effect on the reduction in parking.</p>

	                    </p>
	                    <p><strong>Limitations</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>As with most regional simulations, the accuracy of data is the largest potential limitation of the study. It is definite to collect accurate data for an entire metropolitan region, though this analysis does use the latest and most accurate data available to the regional government and is the same model applied for regional EIR. In addition, as already discussed, the data on parking requirements is only available for about half of the Bay Area jurisdictions and none of this data involves information at a parcel-scale zoning level. As such, the scenarios described in this document are assumption-driven using reasonable assumptions for current conditions and potential reductions in parking requirements. Although the results of the simulations will not be parcel-accurate, the results are applicable to policy-oriented debates currently taking place in the Bay Area.</p>
	                    <p>Additionally, there are a few assumptions that are made in the real estate model that should be acknowledged. For instance, specifications that are developed in actual real estate markets, such as residential unit types (1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, and 3 bedroom) and factors of building design including earthquake zones, high slopes, etc. are not represented. Nonetheless, it is thought that the UrbanSim real estate model is a best practices model of residential development and sufficient for the analysis described in this document.</p>
	                    <p>A major limitation to the analysis with Bay Area UrbanSim stems from the difficulty in simulating user demand for less parking or no parking as well as the value of a parking space for different market segments. For now, an assumption that the amount of parking that will be built is equivalent to the parking requirements is used. It is clear that even in the case of no parking requirements, some amount of parking will be built nevertheless because of market demand. At this time, quality empirical data on how many people will pay for parking and how much they would pay in various situations is not available.</p>
	                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
	                    <p><em>What (if any) impediments inhibit our ability to answer the question entirely?</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>There are many complexities to where development occurs, and a great deal of variation in conditions in the region. It can be very difficult to isolate the impact of parking requirements.</li>
	                        <li>The particular analyses using the modeling tools UrbanSim is cutting edge research and, as such, has not been done previously. The development of this model and the data input allows us to quickly generalize findings to a large area; however, results are not meant to be interpreted on smaller scales or for detailed assessments.</li>
	                        <li>Analyzing differences between cities with various parking policies is helpful for a qualitative review of how policies are used by cities. However, there are a variety of factors that influence the characteristics of each city and location, so while this information will be collected, correlations between key indicators and parking demand does not equate to causation.</li>
	                        <li>Private parking is often hard to capture in data collection due to lots that are not directly visible from the street and only accessible via private property. This could hinder data collection to understand discrepancies between actual parking inventory and the parking requirements.</li>
	                        <li>Analysis is based on generalized parking requirement information for the region. One challenge with this information—minimum parking requirements—is that the requirements do not always correspond with what is actually built. Therefore, general region-wide requirements were estimated for all jurisdictions within the Bay Area. For example, development may have been built before the requirements; received special permission to build lower amounts; or built in excess of required amounts.</li>
	                    </ul>
	                    <p><span style="color:#000080;"><em>2. Policy Question: How much demand exists for housing with lower amounts of parking? At what prices and in which areas?</em></span>
	                    </p>
	                    <h3>Question Purpose</h3>
	                    <p><em>What is the purpose of this question, why is it important, and who is the intended audience?</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>Building excess parking for residential uses increases the total cost of a development, which is then passed on to the resident. If the resident doesn’t use all of the parking, this construction is wasted, when the cost of the housing could have been lower or funds could have been applied to other amenities with more demand. In areas with alternative options for traveling—including public transit, walking, biking and carsharing—an increasing number of households are opting out of vehicle ownership and/or deciding to reduce the number of vehicles they own and increase the use of active modes, sharing and carpooling. However, excess free parking dis-incentivizes these decisions, and increases the cost of housing.</p>
	                    <p>The regional agencies (MTC, ABAG) have goals for adequate levels of housing for low income households. In addition, they have goals to reduce the production of greenhouse gasses. To the extent that there is demand for lower cost housing with less parking, both goals can be addressed. MTC has some resources to put toward the development of low cost housing, such as through the Bay Area Transit-Oriented Affordable Housing Fund (TOAH), but these resources are very limited and would best be focused where there is high demand. If there is more demand for housing with lower amounts of parking, new developments by the private sector could reduce rental and home purchase costs &#8211; if the local jurisdictions will allow it.</p>
	                    <h3>Overview of Analysis</h3>
	                    <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>In the abstract, we would like to know how the availability and cost of parking affects a person’s housing choice. If parking cost is separated from rent, will that affect the demand for a particular housing development? If parking cost is included in rent, how does that affect demand for the development? Is there any difference in demand based upon geographic location or proximity to transit? One way to get at this information would be survey-based, asking individuals how much they would pay for a parking space if it were not included in their housing costs. This information could be compared to the amount that each parking space increases the cost of the development. Because parking costs would be set by the private market rather than parking requirements, studying unbundled parking could also be used to address this question.</p>
	                    <p>However, because this project will aim to maximize supply and occupancy data across the San Francisco Bay Area, over additional data collection, a survey method will not be used. This question is answered with a combination of background research and data analysis. Household auto ownership rates by location and income level can be analyzed spatially (GIS) to visualize information about demand within the region. Collaboration with TransFORM, a local non-profit currently collecting inventory and occupancy data from multi-family residential buildings, allows us to analyze parking supply, prices and usage for many residential buildings.</p>

	                        <a name="_Toc387829961"></a><strong>Parking Demand and Demographics </strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>A review of California parking requirements in TOD areas found that residential areas typically require 1-2 parking spaces per dwelling unit.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[11]</u></a> However, parking usage in these areas is typically much lower. Literature that specifically looks at parking demand within particular market segments and locations include:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>A 2010 publication by MTC, “Choosing Where We Live,” evaluated the preferences of over 900 households seeking new homes in the Bay Area, using market research techniques to estimate demand for various types of housing. This effort found that approximately one third of the households were quite interested in living in transit oriented development; this group had low auto ownership and high interest in other neighborhood attributes, such as transit, affordable housing, and places to walk. Another third of the households might be interested in transit oriented development if it had the right amenities for them. The report describes the actions that local governments can partake to make their communities more attractive to these market segments. The market demand outstrips the supply for this type of housing/neighborhood, as seen when comparing these preferences to new development patterns and further evidenced by the high prices for living in walkable neighborhoods in San Francisco, as well as in smaller and other lively urban centers. This highlights the potential to revitalize urban areas, reduce greenhouse gasses and reduce traffic congestion by allowing for the construction of this type of housing.</li>
	                        <li>Research has pointed to recent trends in automobile usage for Millennials that could make significant impacts to parking demand in the near future. The percentage of young people with driver’s licenses has been decreasing in recent years. <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><u>[12]</u></a> In 2011, the percentage of 16-to-24 year olds was lowest than it had been since 1963 (at 67%). Vehicle-miles traveled per capita have decreased for Americans as a whole since 2004; “Millennials” or “Generation Y” (age 16-34) are driving significantly less, due to shorter overall trips as well as fewer auto trips per person (National Household Travel Survey, 2011). At the same time, alternative transportation use for 16-to-24 year olds has increased. Looking at trends from 2001 to 2009, research by the Frontier Group (2012), finds that biking for this age group increased 24%, walking increased 16%, and public transit increased by 40%.</li>
	                        <li>“Parking Demand and Zoning Requirements for Suburban Multifamily Housing” (Willson and Roberts, 2010) compares three methods of assessing parking demand in suburban residential areas—(1) field counts, (2) household surveys, and (3) vehicle availability from the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS). The study finds that ACS method was similar to the other two and that minimum parking requirements significantly exceed all three measures of demand. This research supports using a simple method to more accurately assess parking demand needs to set requirements at local levels.</li>

	                    <p>A panel of parking experts—including Donald Shoup, Elizabeth Deakin, Todd Litman, and Meea Kang—were interviewed and asked to give their experiences relating to this policy question. Expert panelist Meea Kang spoke specifically about residential parking demand (including reduced requirements and unbundling policies), as presented below. A detailed review of all expert panel discussions can be found in Appendix B.</p>

	                    </p>
	                    <p>Meea Kang is the President/Co-Founder of Domas Development. She has extensive experience with residential parking as a developer and as a policy advocate. Meea Kang discusses the following related to unbundling:</p>
	                    <p style="padding-left:30px;">As a statewide developer of affordable housing in infill areas around transit for families, the workforce, special needs, seniors and mixed-use projects, I can tell you we are at a pinnacle of lack of affordability of housing in California. It seems as though we in California, and almost everywhere in the U.S., actually care more about free parking for cars than housing for people. I have never met a plan I have not had to change because there is not flexibility in the parking standards. We think in a “one size fits all” mentality. Zoning plans are additive. If we want walkable communities that prioritize the pedestrian, we need to rethink parking standards. For every single project I have done in California, I have had to reduce the parking requirements because they do not fit and they are so excessive – especially for the infill populations we are building to accommodate. Our codes today also do not recognize the different modes of transportation now available – transit-oriented developments, Uber, Lyft, carsharing, and bicycling. People are moving away from cars and our codes need flexibility to address that fact. Why is it difficult to change? Because the constituents are controlling the dialogue and the NIMBY’s do not want new developments, which they believe, will affect their ability to find parking. Therefore, we tell new developers they must fix all of the problems of the past and provide more off-street parking. Why? Because everybody’s concern is spillover parking into residential areas.</p>
	                    <p style="padding-left:30px;">One of the challenges in the Bay Area is the missing middle – that housing group in between the very affordable housing and the super high-end housing. That leaves the middle to the suburbs (i.e. Tracy, Brentwood, etc). How are we going to start using our existing downtown areas? Eliminate parking requirements because not everyone owns a car anymore. We are seeing a shift in vehicle ownership. San Francisco is now at 0.59 cars per person and Los Angeles has a 0.54 per capita car ownership rate. That is less than a car per each person. Yet we still have cities that require off-street parking requirements that force developers to ask Planning Commissions to reduce the parking requirement.</p>
	                    <p style="padding-left:30px;">Due to these experiences, I am working on statewide parking reform through the legislature with AB 744 (Chau). We have failed twice before because jurisdictions want to have local control over their area. Every jurisdiction wants to have their own parking variances to accommodate their populations. However, we need to look at this as a statewide and regional issue and consider that housing affordability is a statewide problem.</p>
	                    <p style="padding-left:30px;">AB 744 will look at the following:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>Eliminating minimum parking requirements for 100% affordable housing within a half-mile of transit;</li>
	                        <li>For inclusionary housing under SB 1818 with a small percentage of affordability and the remainder market rate housing your parking ratio could go down to 0.5 per bedroom; and</li>
	                        <li>For special needs or senior housing that is 100% affordable, regardless of location, parking requirements could be eliminated.</li>
	                        <li>I build affordable housing statewide and I would like to give you some averages:</li>
	                        <li>For special needs housing the average median income is $11,600 per individual.</li>
	                        <li>For a senior housing regular tax credit project, the average income is $21,000/annually.</li>
	                        <li>For a family of three housing project the average income is $23,000/annually.</li>
	                        <li>Car ownership averages $10,000/annually. We need to shift our perspective to create a vision of a sustainable California, as under AB 32 and SB 375 and the great work that MTC and ABAG are doing by projecting a vision of how we can move there. If we eliminate minimum parking requirements, we can start to move that needle. We need to project a vision of how we can move there and start to build more housing for people rather than build more free parking for cars.</li>
	                        <li>The demographics we are building homes for would like the option of not having to own a car and use that $10,000 annual cost on other necessities. We need to consider these facts when requiring developers to provide off-street parking.</li>

	                    <p>Data analysis showed that for every additional required parking space per unit, there are 40 more unused spaces, or 9% more unused parking per residence. Demand stays relatively constant regardless of the size of the complex (a .05% reduction in demand for every 100 additional units). However, because bigger residential buildings provide more overall parking, the number of unused spaces increases significantly for larger buildings. For every increase in 100 residential units, there is a 26-space increase in unused parking spaces. This shows that parking should not be provided on a linear scale; more units means more potential for shared and unbundled parking.</p>
	                    <p><strong>Unbundled Parking</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>Overall, residences with unbundled parking provided 0.21 fewer spaces per unit, but overall occupancy of parking spaces was 4% less than units that bundled parking costs with rent costs. On average, units with unbundled parking had 0.62 occupied spaces per unit; because unbundled residences provided less parking per unit on average, there was an 68% overall occupancy. Units with parking bundled with rent had 0.76 occupied spaces per unit and 72% overall occupancy. However, only seven (7) of the 69 buildings unbundled parking, so the overall sample size is small.</p>

	                    </p>
	                    <p>While it appears from market research and analysis of building trends that there is more demand for housing with lower levels of parking than is currently available, the limited supply of such housing makes it difficult to fully assess the size of the market. Additionally, attitudes towards vehicle ownership are changing quickly and are likely to change more in the next several years, as vehicle ownership trends are shifting.</p>
	                    <p>An additional challenge with the analysis for this question is the availability of data on parking requirements, supply, and demand. A very high number of TransForm residential sites are affordable housing sites, leading to lower parking requirements as well as a non-representative level of demand.</p>

Because unbundled parking creates a separation between housing costs and the cost of parking, it allows residents to choose the number of parking spaces they wish to use and pay accordingly. Additionally, if residents decide to forego car ownership, or reduce their personal vehicle ownership, they can also save money by giving up their parking space. This incentivizes households to live car-free, or give up their first or second vehicle. This question is intended to provide regional agencies with a sense of the impact of parking on development patterns, as a background for considering any regional parking policies. It is also intended to provide information for local jurisdictions in considering the potential impacts of local parking policies.</p>

	                    <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>In the abstract, we would like to know where people would choose to live under various situations of parking supply and prices for housing and parking. Additionally, we would like to know how vehicle ownership decisions may change when the true costs of parking are more transparent and offered as a housing option rather than requirement. However, because this information is not easily gained, we will review best practice research and review the findings of unbundling applications as well as lessons learned from the experience of parking experts.</p>

	                    </p>
	                    <p>Unbundled parking separates housing and parking costs. Traditionally, the cost of an apartment or condo unit includes one or more parking spaces, regardless of whether the tenant/owner is using them or not. Unbundling allows residents to choose the number of parking spaces they use and pay for accordingly. Additionally, if residents decide to forego, give up, or reduce their personal vehicle ownership, they can also save money by giving up their parking space. This allows them to conserve or prioritize their household budget for other purposes. In recent studies surveying a range of areas, Littman (2006) found that unbundling parking produces impacts similar to parking pricing, reducing automobile ownership by 5-15%. Several options for unbundling parking include:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>Parking spaces are not included in the base rent/purchase cost, and are rented by the tenant/owner separately.</li>
	                        <li>Landlords/condo associations can provide a discount to renters/owners who do not want to use the standard number of parking spaces.</li>
	                        <li>Landlords/condo associations can create a secondary market for parking by renting unused spaces out as a separate commodity.</li>
	                        <li>Unbundling can be used as a municipal code tool that allows developers to reduce the amount of parking they are required to provide.</li>

	                    <ul>
	                        <li>Facing extreme crowding of city streets with cars from local residents, and a robust transit system heavily used to commute to jobs in New York City, the City of Hoboken, New Jersey developed a program to encourage residents to forego their residential parking permits. Residents giving up their residential permits are provided a combination of discounted carshare usage, bicycle amenity discounts and a local bicycle map, temporary parking placards, discounted gym membership, and a discount on athletic apparel. Key to the program success has been the Corner Car program, which provides free carshare membership and is available within a 5 minute walk to more than 90 percent of city residents. Participation is on an annual basis, allowing for changes as needs change.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[13]</u></a>

	                    </p>
	                    <p>A 2010 Value Pricing Pilot (VPP) project in San Francisco looked unbundling parking in residential buildings combined with the policy of including carsharing spaces within the residential parking facilities.<a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2"><u>[14]</u></a> The analysis found that this combined policies significantly reduced household vehicle ownership rates; apartments with the presence of carsharing and unbundled parking had an average vehicle ownership rate of 0.76 vehicles/unit compared to apartments without carsharing and unbundled parking that had an average vehicle ownership rate of 1.04 vehicles/unit. 22% of the residents surveyed responded that the presence of carsharing impacted their residential location choice. San Francisco’s Planning Code relating to unbundled parking can be found in Section 167: “Parking costs separated from housing costs in new residential buildings.&#8221; <a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2"><u>[15]</u></a>

	                    </p>
	                    <p>While San Francisco has taken bold steps with City-wide unbundling policies, several other places have allowed unbundled and parking requirements on a case-by-case basis. For example, approximately 50% of multi-family buildings in central Seattle have unbundled parking from rents.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><u>[16]</u></a> Research has shown many successful examples of unbundling, yet the largest challenge includes clearly communicating the policies to buyers and rents. Some additional examples include:</p>
	                    <p>Arlington County, VA Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) corridor has taken several steps to manage and reduce parking demand. The Market Common development in the City of Clarendon has taken advantage of both reduced minimums through shared parking as well as unbundling parking costs from rents. The unbundled parking is $25/month for the first vehicle per unit, $75/month for the second, and $100/month for the third. Studies of parking use show that even at peak demand, parking facilities are less than 80% occupied.</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>Downtown Bellevue, WA (located in the greater Seattle region) has implemented an unbundled parking policy by requiring multi-family residences to charge parking costs separate from rents in addition to establishing maximum parking requirements. The results of these policies have been a drive-alone commute rate decrease of 30% (some studies report higher rates<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><u>[17]</u></a>). In addition to multi-family residences, office buildings in downtown are also required to unbundle parking costs from the costs to lease space. This policy makes it easier for employers to implement cash-out policies and incentivizes shared parking policies.</li>
	                        <li>The Gaia Building in Downtown Berkeley has unbundled parking, separating rents from a monthly parking price of $150/space. When the apartment first opened, the apartment had 237 residents and 91 units, yet demand exists for only 20 spaces despite 42 available spaces (some spaces used for carsharing).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><u>[18]</u></a>
	                        </li>
	                        <li>Dudley Village in Dorchester, MA: In Massachusetts, the 2006 TOD Bond Program gave $2 million for Dudley Village (a mixed-use affordable housing development) in Dorchester, MA. The development has unbundled parking with only 0.7 parking spaces per unit.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><u>[19]</u></a>
	                        </li>
	                        <li>In a St. Louis TOD condo project, close to a MetroLink transit stop, tenants were given the option to purchase a parking space for $18,000. Because of this option, developers are able to sell the “Ballpark Lofts” at relatively low costs compared to other units in the area for those who opt out of car-ownership. Given this choice, almost a quarter of the condo buyers decided against the purchase of a parking space. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><u>[20]</u></a>

	                    <p><strong>Expert Analysis</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>A panel of parking experts—including Donald Shoup, Elizabeth Deakin, Todd Litman, and Meea Kang—were interviewed and asked to give their experiences relating to this policy question. Expert panelist Todd Litman spoke specifically about unbundled parking, presented below. A detailed review of all expert panel discussions can be found in Appendix B.This panel discussed how efficient pricing of parking is the second best way to achieve your congestion reduction by charging efficiently for roads. A city by definition is an area within a limited space and optimal density for vehicles is just as important to consider as the optimal density of people. The panel agreed that we need to redefine the problem by saying the average person is going to be better off with efficient parking management; we need to educate people to the fact that no parking is ever free – you pay for it either directly or indirectly; we also need to communicate the fact that underpriced parking is as economically inefficient and unfair as overpriced parking.</p>
	                    <p><strong>Expert Panelist – Todd Litman</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>The most fundamental principle of good planning is that individual short-term decisions should be consistent with and support your long-term strategic goals. Our goals include climate change emissions reduction, but also reduction in congestion and traffic incidents and social inequity. The challenge we have is about communication. Most people have never purchased a parking space as a separate item. Parking is included with the house we buy, included in the taxes we pay, included with our employment, included in the price of the item we buy from a store. Most people do not understand the true cost of a parking space. Most structured parking spaces cost more than the vehicle that occupies them and that is the message we need to communicate. We can communicate this easily by explaining that it is more rational to give away cars and charge the true cost of the parking space, than to charge for the car and give away the parking spaces. We need to turn this information into a positive statement – by charging directly for parking rather than having the cost of parking borne indirectly we are offering consumers a new way to save money that currently does not exist. The best example is unbundling parking. Are you better off paying $1,000/month for an apartment with a parking space or $900/month for an apartment and $100/month for a parking space that you actually use? Which makes people better off? The unbundled parking with the option to choose does. These are new opportunities to save money – unbundled parking or parking cash-out programs.When it comes to supply parking, unbundling will let us use basic economic/market theory – where parking demand is defined at relative to the cost of providing that parking space. If consumers are willing to pay the real cost of that parking space, then they should get it. However, it does turn out that actual demand goes down 20% or more when you actually price the space at its true cost.Todd Litman, from the Victoria Transport Policy Institute, suggested applying these strategies to residential parking. One detail that often gets over-looked is that our residential zoning codes require off-street parking spaces. Every time we build an off-street parking space, we install a driveway and every driveway displaces one on-street parking space. The primary mechanism we use to provide parking spaces gives you almost zero net increase in parking supply for single –family housing in urban areas. It actually reduces our parking supply because the on-street space can be shared by others on the street. Almost everyone would be better off if instead of zoning codes requiring generous off-street parking, we simply managed the on-street parking more efficiently in residential areas.</p>
	                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
	                    <p><em>What (if any) impediments inhibit our ability to answer the question entirely?</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>While unbundling parking has been considered a best practice for several years now, City-wide applications are limited. Unbundling typically is implemented during the planning of a new residential development, therefore, before and after data collection is not possible and projects must rely on comparable project data, if available.There is a lot of potential to simulate the effects of unbundled parking with the regional land use and transportation model, UrbanSim. However, the capabilities of the UrbanSim model are still being tested as the development of the program progresses. Currently, the data availability in UrbanSim is not robust enough to model this question accurately.Potential Policy ActionsPotential policy actions include requiring the reduction or elimination of local minimum parking requirements in Transit Priority Areas (TPAs) or Priority Development Areas (PDAs) as a condition for regional funding. Another potential regional policy is to require the adoption of a parking policy that includes key smart parking strategies for eligibility for OBAG2. In the local arena, policies that reduce parking requirements and support new development in high density areas should be evaluated by local agencies.There are several parking policy actions that can be implemented to supply residential demand for households that would prefer to live in more transit-oriented areas and avoid or reduce their vehicle ownership. Policies that provide funding for subsidized carshare in locations that provide some housing without parking or with very low parking requirements. Additionally, policies that include criteria of car free housing in evaluation for regional funding programs could support these goals.</p>

	                    <p>In addition to local policies to support unbundling in multi-family residential buildings as well as multi-employer office buildings, there are several regional actions that can be taken to increase the amount of unbundled parking. One potential policy is to require unbundling of parking in PDAs and/or TPAs within OBAG requirements, or as a condition of particular funds (station area plans, technical assistance, or other). Another is to include requirements for unbundling and other smart growth parking policies in the regional principles for reviewing projects in the Cap and Trade AHSC Program (in addition to current requirements). Last, a policy that allows carshare pods to replace required parking spaces could encourage additional mode options in place of private car ownership.</p>

	                    <h2>UrbanSim Analysis</h2>
	                    <p>Bay Area UrbanSim is the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s (MTC’s) regional land use model. The model is used to analyze how planning policies affect the location choices of households, businesses, and real estate developers over the long term (i.e, 20 to 30 years). In addition to the methodology and results presented below, Appendix A outlines additional model assumptions.</p>
	                    <p>UrbanSim was used to model reduced or eliminated minimum parking requirements over a 15-year simulation period to analyze a forecast for the location and type of development throughout the region in that timeframe. The implementation was designed in such a way that the assumptions can be adjusted and simulations rerun to analyze the sensitivity of development to changes in parking requirements. Three simulations are modeled, including:</p>
	                    <ol>
	                        <li>A baseline scenario where parking requirements are set and do not change throughout the region,</li>
	                        <li>A reduced requirement scenario where parking minimum requirements are halved within Transit Priority Areas (TPAs) and remain constant outside TPAs, and</li>
	                        <li>An eliminated requirement scenario where parking minimum requirements are set to zero within Transit Priority Areas (TPAs) and remain constant outside TPAs.</li>
	                    </ol>
	                    <h4>Methodology</h4>
	                    <p><strong>Data</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>There is an existing UrbanSim implementation in the Bay Area, which was developed for the 2014 Bay Area regional plan – Plan Bay Area – and associated Environmental Impact Report. For the existing implementation, the necessary parcel, building, household, and employment data are already available. Existing model specifications for residential and non-residential prices, as well as household and employment location choice models are also available. As the next Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for the Bay Area is due in 2017, and UrbanSim is slated be a key component in testing alternative land use scenarios for the new plan. These model configurations are still subject to change for the next policy implementation.</p>
	                    <p>New data has been collected regarding typical baseline parking requirements in the 101 Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) jurisdictions,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> but data for only around 50 of the cities is readily available at this time. In order to address Policy Question #2 for the VPP Parking Project, baseline parking requirements are assumption-based, as data specificity is insufficient to claim parcel-level understanding of parking requirements throughout the Bay Area. In this way, the assumptions can be simply and transparently communicated to stakeholders.</p>
	                    <p><strong>Parking Requirement Assumptions</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>Parking requirements are defined for either residential, industrial, office, or retail building types. Parking requirements are per unit for residential uses and per 1000 square feet for non-residential uses. Current parking requirement assumptions for the “no project” scenario are specified by the project team,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> based on parking requirement data for 50 cities within the Bay Area. Using the data from these 50 cities, the mean upper-minimum parking requirements for each land use type are used to create a reasonable default to represent regional average parking requirements (with the exception of San Francisco, where requirements are set lower).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> These averages are rounded to the nearest 0.5 spaces. Therefore, region-wide parking requirements are 3.0 spaces per residential unit (for San Francisco 1.0 spaces per residential unit); 4.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet of retail space; and 4.0 spaces per 1,000 square feet of office space.</p>
	                    <p>With these assumptions, parking requirements will vary by building type but not by jurisdiction (with the exception of the City of San Francisco). If data on minimum parking requirements improves in the future, parking requirements can be specific to jurisdictions or even within jurisdictions, as the UrbanSim simulation is entirely parcel-based (with some residential unit level representation also available).</p>
	                    <p><strong>Scenarios</strong>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>The assumptions specified by building type and density were applied to all proposed developments in the region. The modeling process includes a baseline “no project” simulation to compare scenario results to. The second scenario will reduce parking requirements by half within Transit Priority Areas (TPAs). For the third scenario, parking requirements will be reduced to zero. TPAs are used as the basic geography for reduction of parking requirements, as a reasonable assumption is that parking requirements cannot be reduced without meeting transportation demand with some other mode, most likely transit and non-motorized modes in the dense built environments around transit hubs.</p>
	                    <h4>Summary of Results</h4>
	                    <p>The relative amount of growth within areas where minimum parking requirements were reduced in Transit Priority Areas (TPAs) was calculated in order to interpret change in minimum parking requirements from simulations. TPAs represent approximately half percent of the land area in the Bay Area. The results of the scenarios are represented by the percentage of residential and non-residential <em>growth</em> in built space inside and outside of TPAs, for residential and non-residential separately. In other words, given that we are assuming population and job growth to be constant across scenarios, the number of net residential units and net job spaces is roughly constant across scenarios as well. The simple metric of how much of that growth falls within TPAs for each of the three scenarios is a first estimate at the global impact of the reduction in parking on changes in the built environment. These simple summaries are provided below.</p>
	                    <p>The baseline model predicts that 73.2 percent of residential growth and 60.0 percent of non-residential growth will occur in TPAs throughout the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area region. When parking requirements are reduced by one-half, the amount of residential growth within the TPA increases by 2.2 percent; non-residential growth within the TAP increases by 3.1 percent. Similarly, when requirements are completely eliminated, both residential and non-residential growth within the TPAs increase by 3.5 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively. The reduction due to reducing requirements by one-half has an incrementally larger impact relative to eliminating parking requirements, indicating there is a small nonlinear effect on the reduction in parking.</p>

	                    <h4>UrbanSim Limitations</h4>
	                    <p>As with most regional simulations, the accuracy of data is the first and foremost limitation of the study. Many data issues exist in the baseline UrbanSim data, especially the parcel, zoning, and building data, and data cleaning is already the main objective of a current UrbanSim work. In addition, as already discussed, the data on parking requirements is only available for about half of the Bay Area jurisdictions and none of this data involves information at a parcel-scale zoning level. As such, the scenarios described in this document are assumption-driven using reasonable assumptions for current conditions and potential reductions in parking requirements. Although the results of the simulations will not be parcel-accurate, the results are applicable to policy-oriented debates currently taking place in the Bay Area.</p>
	                    <p>Second, as the UrbanSim model is in the middle of a production run which won’t be delivered until 2017, numerous improvements will take place in the coming years that are not currently complete. The improvement to the base year built environment already mentioned is one important improvement, as well as an improvement in non-residential price data and associated statistical models. At this time, non-residential rent data and models are not as accurate as the analogous residential models. Additionally, the current model system has not been calibrated and validated to current observed trends. This work will be performed in the next two years, and the parking simulations can be rerun to check for any changes due to these improvements in the model.</p>
	                    <p>Finally, there are a few assumptions that are made in the pencil out pro formas that should be acknowledged. For instance, specifications that are developed in actual real estate markets, such as residential unit types (1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, and 3 bedroom) and factors of building design including earthquake zones, high slopes, etc. are not represented. Nonetheless, it is thought that the UrbanSim pro forma is a best practices model of residential development and sufficient for the analysis described in this document.</p>
	                    <p>Most relevant to this project is the fact that reducing parking requirements are assumed to reduce parking. This is an assumption that must be made because of poor observed data on the willingness of people to pay for parking when it is <em>not</em> required. In other words, it is clear that even in the case of no parking requirements, some parking will be built anyway because many people are willing to pay for it. At this time, quality empirical data on how many people will pay for parking and how much they would pan in various situations is not at all clear. For now, an assumption of the amount of parking that will be built is used, rather than trying to predict the demand for parking (in terms of the willingness to pay) with insufficient information.</p>

	                    <p><em>What is the purpose of this question, why is it important, and who is the intended audience?</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>This question will provide MTC, transit agencies, and cities with information that would allow for better investment of funds through more cost conscious and appropriate sizing of parking structures; it will also give support for cost effective investments into alternative modes. Altogether, this question is intended to explore policies that will better utilize limited transportation funds, make better use of existing parking supplies, and encourage alternative travel modes in order to reduce the oversupply of underpriced parking spaces in future developments.</p>
	                    <h3>Overview of Analysis</h3>
	                    <p><em>How is this question being addressed? What approach is best, given limitations? </em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>This question is being addressed through a review of existing papers and an analysis of policy applications and related studies and supplemented with regional Travel Model One analysis. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> In the abstract, this question would be answered by analyzing each case individually, assessing the need, cost, transit service and other alternative mode access to each site where parking structures are planned or proposed.</p>
	                    <p>In addition to a review of best practice research and analysis methods, the Bay Area’s Travel Model One was used to look at how eliminated parking as well as increased housing affects BART ridership.</p>
	                    <h2>Background &amp; Research</h2>
	                    <h4>Literature Review:</h4>
	                    <p>Best Practice: Pricing Parking near Transit Stations</p>
	                    <p>In theory, pricing of parking at transit stations where the parking is regularly used to full capacity could lead to increased transit ridership, through a couple processes. First, priced parking results in some local residents who otherwise drive to instead choose to walk, bicycle or take transit to a close station. Second, some riders from farther away will carpool to minimize their parking expense. In both cases this frees up the station parking for others who drive and park, some of whom were not taking transit previously due to the lack of parking availability. However, there has been only limited research to determine the size of this effect.</p>
	                    <p>Replacing Parking with TOD</p>
	                    <p>Several studies have looked at mode share in housing adjacent to transit stations. Lund, Cervero, and Willson (2004) find that residents living near transit stations are approximately five times more likely to travel to work via transit relative to an average resident in that city. However, this amount varies greatly by city and region. This study (Lund, Cervero, and Willson, 2004) found that about 19% of trips by residents near Pleasant Hill BART took transit and 27% of trips by residents (N=176) near Alameda County BART stations took transit (N=177).</p>
	                    <p>The Effects of TOD on Housing, Parking and Travel (TCRP Report 128, Arrington &amp; Cervero, 2008) states that TOD commuters are two to five times as likely to use transit modes. The authors found that the primary reason for this higher percentages in self-selection, where residents chose to live nearby transit due to their preferred access mode.</p>
	                    <p>Fehr &amp; Peers (2006) conducted a study of average household BART mode share and distance from station and found that residents within ½ mile from BART stations average a 16.4% BART mode share.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[2]</a> A study by Cervero (1993) found that residents adjacent to BART stations averaged 26.8% rail mode split (sites within 2/3 mile of BART station).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[3]</a>

	                    <p><u>BART TOD and Replacement Parking Policies</u>: In 2005, BART developed a modeling tool to evaluate replacement parking when new development impacts existing parking facilities around BART Stations. BART previously had a one-to-one parking replacement requirement, but came to realize that this policy was discouraging transit-oriented development around stations. This model looks at each scenario specifically, evaluating current conditions as well as future scenarios and visions for growth. Shared parking, pricing, or other supply and demand management policies are evaluated and incorporated into the planning process to determine how a replacement parking strategy should progress. However, the model does not consider regional-scale effects and instead takes a local approach by not incorporating system-wide parking supply and demand. In addition, BART now uses a corridor approach which identifies different roles for different stations along a line, identifying certain stations as key TOD opportunity sites and shifting parking demand to other stations.</p>
	                    <p><u>Replacement Parking at VTA Light Rail Stations</u>: Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority (VTA) evaluated how much parking should be replaced to accommodate proposed TOD development at 13 light rail stations in San Jose. This evaluation included various policy strategies to reduce parking demand, encouraging diverse station areas that are not automobile-oriented. After determining which stations do not have enough parking capacity to accommodate estimated future use at these free lots, VTA determined alternative methods to accommodate the projected demand. Rather than constructing additional parking facilities (a very high-cost option), VTA decided to (1) reduce parking demand by improving alternative-mode access and implementing Travel Demand Management (TDM) policies, and (2) implement shared parking with adjacent land uses that have unused parking during commute hours. In addition to balancing supply and demand, these policies aligned with the agency’s TOD program goals.</p>
	                    <p>Best Practice: Parking Structure Analysis</p>
	                    <p>MTC’s Parking Structure Technical Report (Nelson\Nygaard and Dyett and Bhatia, 2011) describes the opportunities and challenges that are related to parking structures. While parking structures can benefit a community in several ways, challenges with parking structures include (1) not enough demand to support the need for a structure, (2) high monetary, environmental, and opportunity costs, and (3) impacts to the community with design, circulation, and safety concerns. The purpose of this report is to provide guidance on fully evaluating the need for parking structures—a multimillion dollar investment—before the investment is made. In addition to providing a 6-step evaluation framework, this report highlights three case studies where parking has been successfully reevaluated:</p>
	                    <p><u>”Right Sizing” Parking (MTC):</u> A 2012 report addresses characteristics of proposed new parking structures serving transit in the Bay Area. This study looks in depth at 19 parking structures that are planned or in progress and describes the net cost per new parking space, amount and source of funding, the purpose, and the potential for reduced parking. It applies network analyst to highlight the difference between theoretical access and actual access for nearby populations within 10 minutes through for bicycle and walk modes, suggesting the potential for specific infrastructure improvements to capture more riders through these modes. Opportunities for reduced parking, such as shared parking or nearby available parking supply are identified. For example, the study identifies an opportunity for the San Leandro Boulevard structure to increase bicycle/pedestrian access as a demand management strategy (<strong>Figure 4</strong>).</p>

	                    <p><u>Petaluma Station Area Plan Parking Policies</u>: In 2012, Petaluma conducted station area plans for two SMART rail stations within the City that are slated for TOD developments for horizon year 2035. The evaluation showed that additional parking would be unnecessary, as current supplies were greater than the projected parking demand. The study resulted in several key findings, including:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>Opportunities to manage park-and-ride demand and increase transit-oriented development will potentially allow the initial parking supply to be replaced with new development and shared parking.</li>
	                        <li>Parking structures would be a significant cost-factor as well as a potential barrier against maximizing the value of the land.</li>
	                        <li>Rail and transit served locations will have lower parking requirements than conventional suburban parking ratios, provided that a parking management plan is in place.</li>
	                        <li>Shared parking, flexible use of supply, Transportation Demand Management plans, pricing, and Parking Benefit Districts were all recommended to manage the supply and demand of SMART Station Areas.</li>

	                    <p>When the cost and ridership impacts of parking is compared to TOD development around suburban BART stations, a study funded by MTC (Wilbur Smith Associates, 2011) found that ridership generated by BART parking could be achieved with housing around stations instead of parking, and would generate more revenues for BART.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[4]</a> Even near suburban stations (assuming that 25-35% of total trips are via BART for households around stations), higher density housing can be competitive with parking lots in terms of generating riders. Additionally, analysis of parking costs and pricing showed that station parking lots are significantly underpriced, given the value of the station-area land as well as the cost of constructing the parking. Parking fees would need to be increased two to four times their current levels at BART lots and structures in order for BART to break even.</p>

	                    <p>The Victoria Transport Policy Institute (<a href="http://www.vtpi.org">www.vtpi.org</a>) has created a spreadsheet tool to calculate the estimated costs for parking facilities, recovery pricing, and revenue generation. This tool is useful for estimating how much a new parking facility would cost to construct and operate; estimating the prices that a facility should charge to recover construction and operating costs; and estimating revenues and profits that are generated from charging various prices. This calculator is valuable in its inclusion of different land use types (suburban, urban, and central business district) and its ability to input more context-specific values—such as the cost of land and interest rates—if necessary. However, it is a cost-revenue analysis and does not include any user choice, supply, or demand information.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[5]</a>

	                    <p>In 2007, the City of Union City began Phase I of the Intermodal Station project, improving multi-modal station access as part of an effort to adapt the area for future TOD. This effort included improving bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities around the BART station and parking lot. Due to a high demand for parking, this effort was conducted to manage demand and avoid the expense of constructing a new parking facility. To encourage TOD development instead of increasing parking supply, the City began implementing paid parking in April 2010 by installing pay-stations throughout their on-street and off-street parking. They have priced their off-street city-owned lots adjacent to the BART station at $3/day or $0.50 per hour.</p>
	                    <p>Before pricing implementation, BART station commuters were parking on-street all day and the lots were full; Union City’s pricing strategy was successful in both reducing spillover into on-street spaces and also reducing overall parking demand. Analysis of ridership was conducted after parking pricing was implemented with pay-stations; the number of BART commuters did not decrease after the 2009 introduction, yet use of the parking lot decreased, suggesting that users switched to other modes. Now the City experiences approximately $450,000 in net revenues from parking per year. Additionally, the City experienced “almost no public outcry” after implementing the paid parking program.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[6]</a>

	                        <a name="_Toc387829982"></a>Best Practice: Shared Parking</p>
	                    <p>Shared parking—where a single parking lot is used by multiple businesses or organizations—allows off-street resources to be used more efficiently. Often, shared parking can be used as a tool to reduce the number of total parking spaces used; MTC’s “Right Sizing Parking” (2012), identifies many opportunities for planned or proposed parking structures in the Bay Area to be reduced by implementing shared parking. Shared parking makes use of the fact that nearby businesses often have different peak-periods throughout the day—such as a restaurant and a doctor’s office—and also makes use of the fact that many parking facilities have a large portion of unused space during the off-peak periods. Shared parking often reduces the total amount of parking an area uses by 40-60%, reducing the land devoted to parking and therefore potentially improving pedestrian connections between businesses.</p>
	                    <p>Shared parking between different sites can be negotiated by contractual agreements between nearby businesses that have different peak demand times. They can also be organized by parking management districts or BIDs. With both methods, businesses can overlap their parking capacity during these times and reduce the number of spaces that the combined business would otherwise require. Local municipalities can help facilitate shared agreements with private businesses with off-street parking with agreements and legal documentation that may be needed to allow access to other private entities. As a modest approach, local jurisdictions can modify their parking requirements to allow shared parking to count toward satisfaction of the city parking requirements.</p>

	                    <p>Rather than constructing parking on high-value land within mixed-use and commercial areas, lower-value adjacent parking may be available for valet parking. This is especially valuable in avoiding the construction of new facilities where there is underutilized parking supply nearby. Valet parking can be used to reduce the amount of space devoted to parking in pedestrian-friendly retail corridors and also reduce vehicle congestion from cars circling to find parking. This can also expand the supply of parking that is convenient in the most popular commercial areas during the peak period. In many areas, parking is built to accommodate the peak period(s) of the week or year, but is not used for the remainder of the time. In these cases, utilizing off-site lots in areas with different levels of demand for the time of day or week will help provide parking, at a much lower cost than building and maintaining new facilities. For example, parking structures that are primarily used for employees during regular business hours are often severely underutilized during other times of the day and week, and can serve as capacity for entertainment uses that have high demand during the evening period. Private businesses or commercial parking lots can also include valet parking attendants to park vehicles during especially busy periods. Litman (2006) estimates that valet parking can increase parking capacity by 20-40% compared with users parking their own vehicles.</p>
	                    <p>An alternative to valet parking is providing shuttle service for those parking to ride in on from a satellite (off-site) parking lot. Like valet parking services, off-street capacity can help reduce traffic in pedestrian retail centers. Like valet services, a shuttle service could be used to supplement parking supplies only during the times of peak demand. If shuttle service was from a shared parking lot with a complementary demand period to create the commuter lot, it would eliminate the need to expand overall parking supply.</p>

	                    <p>To accommodate high demand at discrete time periods, Redwood City initiated a valet parking program to take advantage of underutilized parking supplies that were located outside of the highly-demanded downtown area.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[7]</a> Parking supply was adequate to serve patrons during most of the week, but was constrained during the peak period. If a new parking structure was constructed, it would have been underutilized for most time periods, and likely would have required substantial on-going subsidies. So instead of constructing new supplies within the downtown, Valet parkers make use of the underutilized parking supplies that were only a quick drive outside of the downtown area, without the inconvenient of parking farther away for patrons. The Redwood City Pilot Valet Parking Program was an effort spearheaded by a local theater owner, in response to overwhelming parking demand in the downtown area during weekend evenings.</p>

	                    <p>In order to get the service started, the business owner worked with City of Redwood City, fellow businesses, and the Downtown Business Association. The program started with a Pilot Valet Program, working with businesses to establish drop off zones and off-site parking lot locations. As of late 2013, the program was proving successful and planning to expand. While the valet program was open to all Downtown patrons, the patrons of member businesses received $5 discount validation for the program. This approach encouraged greater participation from downtown businesses.</p>

	                    <p>As implemented successfully by the City of Union City, pricing can be a strong tool to manage parking usage and reduce the construction of new parking structures. However, private parking is more difficult to manage directly by public agencies. However, there are many ways off-street private parking can be managed. Local governments can control off-street garage prices with increased taxes, which are typically passed on to the garage user in the form of increased parking rates. San Francisco taxes all off-street parking spaces at a rate of 25% of the total parking charges. These taxes are common throughout the U.S.; the Baltimore Parking Authority, for example, collects a higher tax for parking facility transactions in order to increase the user’s cost equivalent to $14 per month.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[8]</a> The highest parking tax in the country is in Pittsburgh, PA, at 40% of the total parking charges.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[9]</a>

	                    <p>Travel Model One Analysis</p>
	                    <p>Modeling Overview</p>
	                    <p>While Policy Question #5 is not fully addressed via modeling methods, this question is partially addressed through MTC’s regional travel demand model, Travel Model One (TMO). The analysis of model scenarios specifically focuses on how pricing fees at Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) parking facilities can affect the demand for parking and transit mode share. Additional factors analyzed include vehicle ownership, trip costs, and BART ridership. Some restrictions on the modeling include:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>Vehicle-access to stations does not distinguish between single-occupancy vehicles, carpools/rideshares, and kiss-and-ride (passengers getting dropping off at stations).</li>
	                        <li>Impact on retail and other land uses is not included in the model.</li>
	                        <li>Parking within model is limited to a Yes/No analysis; the number of parking spaces at each station is not defined.</li>
	                        <li>Government-set on-street parking prices and market-driven private off-street lot prices are not distinguished.</li>
	                    </ul>
	                    <p>Several steps were taken to set up the model and establish the scenarios to be analyzed. First, in order to focus the analysis, a few select stations were chosen. Nine BART stations chosen for the TMO analysis were evaluated based on a qualitative analysis of the UrbanSim regional model’s results was conducted to select a set of stations where it would be feasible to develop TOD in place of parking facilities.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[10]</a> While all stations will be evaluated in terms of impact, the stations where daily fee changes are being implemented include: Ashby, Bay Fair, Coliseum/Oakland Airport, El Cerrito Plaza, Glen Park, Lafayette, Lake Merritt, North Berkeley, Orinda, San Leandro, and West Oakland.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[11]</a>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>The parking costs per station are added to TMO to create a baseline comparison that includes current parking costs. The cost of parking and users willingness-to-pay was evaluated to establish scenarios based on additional parking fee amounts. Last, the MacArthur BART station development was used as a model to estimate additional housing development if the land currently used for parking were instead used for housing. The residential TOD estimates assume the same density of housing as the MacArthur Transit Village Parcel D in Oakland, CA. This development of 5-stories, consisting of 90 units of affordable family housing on 0.78 acres including 2 studios, 22 one-bedroom, 29 two-bedroom, and 37 three-bedroom units (density of 115 du/acre).</p>
	                    <p>Altogether, the analysis of these factors led to the development of four scenarios to evaluate.</p>
	                    <p>Travel Model One Scenarios &amp; Results</p>
	                    <p>Three scenarios were modeled and compared for this analysis: (1) baseline scenario with “no change” conditions, (2) a no-parking scenario with all drive access removed at stations, and (3) a housing scenario with housing built at each station. The amount of housing built is assumed to equal the approximate acreage of current BART parking facilities. Scenario 4 was created by combing a no-parking scenario with a housing scenario—therefore, parking is removed, but housing is added. These scenarios are built in order to estimate the effect of replacing parking with housing.</p>

	                    <p>Travel Model One Summary &amp; Discussion</p>
	                    <p>Transit-oriented development (TOD) expanded past just the BART station facility parking as well as generating additional commercial and office land uses is likely to generate more demand relative to parking. The Travel Model One results shows that while parking alone will provide more ridership, replacing parking with housing makes up approximately one-half of that decrease with merely the 1-to-1 replacement of parking and housing. Additional TOD development adjacent to a parking lot would not only bring more ridership from residents, but also increase office and commercial use as well.</p>
	                    <p>Additional benefits of more station access trips being generated by non-drive modes would also be provided. Without the option to drive, a portion of patrons who previous accessed the station by single-occupancy vehicle would likely take alternative modes.</p>
	                    <p>An additional factor when considering TOD replacement of commuter parking lots at BART stations is BART capacity. TOD development generates more off-peak ridership, shifting demand towards other periods of the day. As BART ridership demand continues to increase while capacity is constrained in the near-term, this could help manage demand as well as increase development of more commuter transportation options, such as transbay bus systems, carpooling, and Bus Rapid Transit.</p>
	                    <p>Cities and transit agencies should consider the benefits of providing TOD development in the place of parking near BART stations. The ridership generated from housing alone replacing the parking lot space is shown to already be half the total ridership gained from the parking facilities. If development demand is higher, providing TOD land uses will (1) encourage development in transit-accessible areas, and (2) generate further demand for more development surrounding stations.</p>
	                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
	                    <p><em>What (if any) impediments inhibit our ability to answer the question entirely?</em>
	                    </p>
	                    <p>It is difficult to apply the same analysis to all parking structures and all areas due to varying land use contexts. Additional work is needed on developing an approach or methodology for evaluating the level of parking and the pricing policies that are effective for different types of land uses in each of the place types. The challenge is to create theoretically robust and operationally effective analytical and policy tools that can be applied to add value in different situations.</p>
	                    <p>The challenges with analyzing the effects of removing parking, pricing parking, building a structure and/or adding TOD is very difficult to do in any model. Many factors are very difficult to predict given limited data and forecasting of the model:</p>
	                    <ul>
	                        <li>If parking were removed, would some demand be accommodated with private commuter lots or nearby on-street parking?</li>
	                        <li>To what extent would TOD development spur a vibrant transit neighborhood, improving businesses revenues as well as increasing development for restaurants, retail, and other commercial uses?</li>
	                        <li>How many residents who previous drove to the station would switch to alternative modes to access the station?</li>
	                        <li>How would additional amenities and services, such as increased bus access and improved bicycle access, as well as decreased convenience of driving to the station increase non-automobile access?</li>
	                    </ul>
	                    <p>Question such as these are context-specific, dependent on many factors and would vary from station-to-station. Previous research highlighted below can help us predict changes, and TMO can look at high-level shifts, but these questions are based on factors such as demographics, land use, timing, as well as planning and implementation.</p>
	                    <h2>Potential Policy Actions</h2>
	                    <p>Local jurisdictions should consider study area vision when deciding to increase parking supply, looking at demand management including multi-modal access to serve residents and manage traffic. Regional policy actions include requiring appropriate planning and financial analysis prior to any regional funding of parking structures, including for Regional Measure 3 (RM3) funding. In evaluating the need for parking structures, local jurisdictions should be sure to analyze financials to evaluate the cost of providing parking, willingness of public to pay at rate that does not require a subsidy, and alternatives to providing additional supply that may bring more benefit to local residents and businesses.</p>
	                    <p>MTC should require a robust analysis of proposed parking structures that includes parking demand and multi-modal access to the service area as well as financial proforma of the proposed facility prior to MTC contribution of regional funds.</p>
